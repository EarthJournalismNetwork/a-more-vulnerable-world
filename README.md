# A More Vulnerable World
In 2015, Internews’ Earth Journalism Network (EJN) supported the creation of 40  in-depth stories about the world’ s most climate vulnerable people and places published in leading outlets throughout the world. [Learn more about the project](https://earthjournalism.net/projects/a-more-vulnerable-world).

Stories were also published in a website created with WordPress and the [JEO Newsroom theme](https://github.com/EarthJournalismNetwork/JEO-Newsroom). In 2020, the website was flattened and all the content was uploaded to this repository. The URL Climate.EarthJournalism.Net is now pointing to this repository via GitHub Pages.
