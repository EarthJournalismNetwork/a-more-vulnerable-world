								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the hills of Mariashoni in the eastern part of Kenya’s Mau Forest Complex, sits an old indigenous <em>Yemdit</em> tree with pale orange-green leaves.</p>
<p>A lone ranger, the tree is surrounded by fresh green commercial eucalyptus trees. A single log beehive – a traditional form of beekeeping to the region’s native population – sits firmly attached to its moss green branches.</p>
<p>This forest – almost unrecognizable – is home to Joseph Chemaina, who was born into Kenya’s indigenous Ogiek community in 1958, when the forest was thick with indigenous trees.</p>
<p>While their numbers back then were closer to 200, the Ogiek population within the Mariashoni area has jumped to approximately 1,700 people of voting age – which is 18 in Kenya – but remains only a minute representation of the estimated 15,000 adult Ogieks living in the Mau Forest Complex and 20,000 across Kenya. Because of the limited data on Ogiek families, these numbers are misleading. With an estimated average family size of ten people, the forest’s Ogiek population could actually be closer to 150,000 people.</p>
<p>“I was born in the forest and when I opened my eyes, all I saw was a forest. A thick forest; every inch you moved, a shrub or tree squeezed your shoulders,” said the 57-year-old Chemaina.</p>
<div id="attachment_186" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/The-log-beehive.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186" class="size-large wp-image-186" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg" alt="A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-186" class="wp-caption-text">A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Each family had its own territory surrounded with a canopy of trees stretching up to 100 meters high.</p>
<p>Here, high atop these branches, the Ogieks would affix log beehives, the backbone of their simple economy. Honey gathered from these hives provided a reliable source of food, income and medicine.</p>
<p>“Honey was in plenty, one Ogiek could have up to 800 beehives,” said Chemaina.</p>
<p>Bees collected nectar and pollen from the indigenous trees, which flowered in different seasons of the year due to regular rainfall and flowing streams.</p>
<p>Back then, the forest provided an abundant source of food and water for the community and Chemaina said he could pick a variety of wild fruits and hunt for rabbits under its dewy cover. Experience had taught the Ogiek to expect brief rains from February to April before the onset of heavier rainfall during the second half of the year. Never, said Chemaina, did it disappoint them.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the flowering season stretched from November to March and the honey harvest yielded ample returns.</p>
<p>“Each beehive produced more than 100 kilogrammes of honey,” he explained.</p>
<p>The Ogieks consider nectar and pollen from the indigenous <em>Tongotwet</em> and <em>Kureyet</em> trees to be very special, and used the dark brown honey as a remedy for chest, stomach, nerve and bone problems.</p>
<p>It was also used as a cure for injuries and fever in children. Expectant mothers drank the thick, dark substance like milk and it served as a disinfectant and wound sanitizer during delivery.</p>
<p>“We survived without the worry of diseases because honey was a powerful dose of medicine,” Chemaina said. But the once rich supply of these indigenous trees began to diminish after illegal logging, charcoal burning and other human activities caused extensive destruction of the forest. Rainfall patterns became less predictable and many local flowering plants started to disappear.</p>
<div id="attachment_190" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree..jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190" class="size-large wp-image-190" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-190" class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Medicinal honey is now a rarity that the Ogieks are forced to accept.</p>
<p>Chemaina now counts only 37 beehives on his 30-acre territory, compared to some 700 he had until early 1990s. “Bee keeping is my life and the life of Ogieks,” he said. “I want to have that life of dense forest back. I want a reverse of the weather patterns – to have the rains as normal.”</p>
<p>But harvesting has been reduced to once in a year and on many occasions, Chemaina has been forced to skip seasons due to lack of honey. Where he used to get 100 kilogrammes from each beehive, he now gets less than 10.</p>
<p>Despite these weather-related challenges, Chemaina said nothing will detach him from the traditional system of rearing bees. He said the demand for the special medicinal honey is even higher since cold weather ailments are affecting him and fellow community members.</p>
<p>“I still need it to help with my chest and fever. It has now become a common problem I have to deal with and hospitals were never part of our lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Augmenting these environmental stresses, the ruthless destruction of the forest over the last two decades has cost the forest community an abundance of wild rabbits, fruits and indigenous vegetation that is critical to their survival.</p>
<p>As early as 1990, people invaded the Mau forest to burn trees into charcoal, an activity that decimated the forest and drove away much of the bee population. By 2000, this damage had spread to more than 100,000 hectares of the forest.</p>
<p>According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), up to 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex’s 416,000 hectares were destroyed between 1990 and 2001.</p>
<p>Cosmas Ikiugu, head of Mau Conservancy in the Kenya Forest Service, said much of the eastern and western parts of the Mau Forest Complex were heavily degraded.</p>
<p>It’s here that more than 150,000 people – including Ogieks – have illegally settled, extending the destruction that the forestry agency admits is a challenge that requires a multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-194" class="size-large wp-image-194" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg" alt="A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-194" class="wp-caption-text">A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>High carbon emissions, soil erosion and decreased groundwater levels are only some of the byproducts of these damaging human activities.</p>
<p>“By 2008, the Mau River was actually drying up. Lake Nakuru which depends on the river was facing a major problem of low water levels,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Teresia Chemutai, a 53-year-old Ogiek woman, said the community relies on water from the Mau River during the dry period since there is no more water flowing freely under their feet.</p>
<p>Groundwater streams such as Segut, Ndoswa and Napuyapui are now extinct, she said.</p>
<p>Women, she said, never went out to hunt for wild meat, rear or harvest honey to feed their families during their days in the forest. But that has changed.</p>
<p>“There is too much work for Ogiek women nowadays. There have to walk long distances to get water, go out to look for food just as men. They bear the burden of ever sickly chicken and give birth to weak children,” she said.</p>
<p>Under bleak circumstances, the Ogiek have reluctantly moved to crop and livestock farming. But the chemical pesticides used to treat the crops is also threatening what’s left of their precious bees.</p>
<p>Chemutai said she started farming in 1997 after the government apportioned her and a few other Ogieks land in the forest. Non-Ogieks that they refer to as “invaders” also received land allocations and to date, the issue remains a grievance that the government has yet to address.</p>
<p>The Ogieks left without government-granted land started farming areas within the territories they originally inhabited.</p>
<p>Chemutai currently has three acres of maize and one of potatoes, but says the practice has been difficult to learn.</p>
<p>“I have been farming for years now, but I still feel I am not used to it,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_187" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187" class="size-large wp-image-187" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg" alt="Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-187" class="wp-caption-text">Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>And just like the trees and flowering plants that have slowly died off, their crops remain susceptible to changes in the weather patterns.</p>
<p>Dry spells threaten maize and potatoes – the main food staples now grown in this area. Many Ogieks still remember a devastating drought that struck the region in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>“We were shocked and worried over the happenings. The crops dried and very little was available for consumption,” said Joseph Barngetuny, a 56-year-old Ogiek farmer.</p>
<p>Recognizing these challenges to traditional ways of life, Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture is educating members of the Ogiek community on the practice of modern beekeeping. “Traditional beehives are no longer productive due to the changed habitat,” said Phillip Owiti, an apiculture officer with the agricultural ministry. “The bee colonies have reduced as a result of unsuitable conditions for survival.”</p>
<p>So far, he said, they have trained 275 Ogieks from Mariashoni who have embraced modern beekeeping.</p>
<p>“We are making all efforts to help them (Ogieks) change their socio-cultural attachment to the environment because the climate change is not sparing their traditional way of keeping bees,” he said.</p>
<p>But results have been mixed. Joseph Barngetuny is one of the farmers who shifted to modern beekeeping. He currently occupies 30 acres of land in Mariashoni and has eight portable beehives, which unlike the traditional log beehives can be erected on sheds or other structures around a farm.</p>

<p>Each, he said, produces no more than 10 kilogrammes of honey, a low production he partly attributes to lost bee colonies, contaminated flowering plants and lack of adequate water sources.</p>
<p>Because of the inadequate harvest, he must continue to grow maize to meet the financial needs of his 20 children from two wives. Though he consumes the honey he produces, he said it has lost the ingredients that made it a special food for the community.</p>
<p>But even more troubling still, the Ogieks lack legal claim to the land they have worked so tirelessly to till. Though they say it’s their ancestral right, it’s a subject that’s rarely mentioned or talked in community circles.</p>
<p>Nahashon Kiptoo, a member of the Ogiek Council of Elders, compared the community’s lack of title deeds to an open wound awaiting a very strong antidote to heal.</p>
<p>“I have developed ulcers imagining us being displaced from here. We fear of other people acquiring title deeds for the parcels of land we are currently occupying. That will be disastrous to us,” said Kiptoo.</p>
<p>The acquisition of title deeds is just one of their pressing needs. The Ogieks also wish for a section of the forest to be officially declared as their secluded home.</p>
<p>Kiptoo said that since their lives begin and end in the forest, they should be allowed to live freely as they did before.</p>
<p>“We will be very happy to go back to [traditional ways of life in the forest]. We miss that life of jumping from one tree to another like monkeys,” said the elder. “We were very strong. We could fall from a 100 metre tree and never died.”</p>
<p>The Ogieks also want a fresh audit of their members to determine how many are in need of title deeds. Findings of a survey done in 2010 by the Interim Mau Restoration Coordinating Secretariat are yet to be made public.</p>
<div id="attachment_189" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189" class="wp-image-189 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on-1024x576.jpg" alt="Obiria - Nahashon Kiptoo shows the wild berries they fed on" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-189" class="wp-caption-text">Nahashon Kiptoo shows off wild berries that are becoming a rarity (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Joseph Towett, who participated in the survey, said the adult Ogiek population in Mau Forest Complex were originally approximated to be 11,000 people. But he puts the current figure closer to 15,000.</p>
<p>“That list is now outdated and several things have changed since then. We need title deeds, support to establish sustainable livelihoods since climate change has adversely affected our lives. We also need engagement in the conservation of Mau,” said Towett, who also chairs the Ogiek Council of Elders.</p>
<p>Ikiugu, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) official, said their concerns over land ownership and engagement in proactive conservation activities is something the government has and will continue to put effort to address.</p>
<p>“We realize that security over land gives them long-term control over the conservation activities in the area which eventually determines rate of climate change,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Ikiugu said they are encouraging the Ogieks to form Community Forest Associations through which they will legally access the benefits accrued from the forests including allocation of land in the forest for cultivation.</p>
<p>A piece of legislation passed in 2005 legalised a system of forest cultivation to forest adjacent communities. Known as the Plantation Establishment for Livelihoods Scheme (PELIS), it allows for community members to access and manage forest land. They are allowed to graze cows and plant crops on a designated plot of land for three years, as long as they also grow trees with certified seedlings provided by KFS. The seedlings are a mix of indigenous and exotic species, with limitations of what can be harvested for timber, but enforcement remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>So far, officials say that 70,000 hectares have been rehabilitated through concerted efforts between the state’s forestry agency and non-state actors, namely the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), among others.</p>
<p>Exotic species such as eucalyptus, cypress and pine have been introduced in 50,000 hectares while the rest has been restored with indigenous trees, Ikiugu said. He believes that high water levels at the Mau River swelling up Lake Nakuru and Mara River are outcomes of the intensive restoration activities at the water tower.</p>

<p>“There is an overflow of water into Lake Nakuru presently submerging houses belonging to the officials at (Lake Nakuru National Park),” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>But Timothy Kiogora, the Nakuru county environmental director, said he remains concerned over the continued practice of the harmful human activities in the forest. Dealing with it requires commitment from all stakeholders, he said.</p>
<p>“It is one thing to tell people about the effects of destroying the forests and how to conserve it but it becomes another issue in converting the information into results,” said Kiogora.</p>
<p>“For people who depend on the forest, you must be able to give them the best alternative to be able to sustainably protect the forest against any destruction,” he added.</p>
<p>The county official said they have outlined effective strategies on educating communities living in the Mau Forest Complex on use of solar and other energy saving cooking stoves to save the forest.</p>
<p>While the government strives to rehabilitate the Mau Forest Complex and assist the Ogieks in adapting to changes in the climate, the community continues to hope that the bees will return.</p>
<p>“It tells a lot about the value of our environment,” said elder council member Kiptoo. “Only by recognising the value of indigenous trees and the ecosystem they enjoyed will we have again stocks of the honey.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Extreme weather events are destroying the silkworms that produce Assam’s famous golden silk</strong></p>
<p>Assam, in North-east India, produces one of the finest, and most expensive, types of silk in the world. Produced by the semi-domesticated silkworm <em>Antheraea assamensis,</em> which is only found in the Brahmaputra Valley, this silk is called <em>Muga</em> –  Assamese for “yellow” or “amber” –  and is often called golden silk. This silk has been produced in the region from as far back as 321 BC, and is an inextricable part of the life and culture of Assam. Unfortunately silkworms are highly sensitive to climatic conditions since they are grown outdoors. Recently unpredictable rainfall patterns, a rise in temperature and persistent floods have endangered <em>Muga</em> cocoon production across the state.</p>
<p>Due to the long history of sericulture, <em>Muga</em> silk occupies a special place in the lives of the indigenous people, inextricably linked to their cultural life. Moreover <em>Muga silk</em> is one of the most expensive silks in the world due its durability and beauty. The lustre of the fabric increases with each wash, making it a product that is treasured – and which lasts – throughout the lifetime of its owner. In 2007, Assam received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for <em>Muga</em> silk. A GI tag is given to products that are produced in a particular area, and boosts the reputation of the product.</p>
<div id="attachment_40" style="width: 993px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40" class="size-full wp-image-40" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg" alt="A set of mekhela chadors made with Assamese muga silk arranged around a japi (Credit: Satnath)" width="983" height="800" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg 983w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40" class="wp-caption-text">A set of mekhela chadors made with Assamese muga silk arranged around a japi (Credit: Satnath)</p></div>
<p>There is a demand for more than 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of <em>Muga</em> silk annually, but the state has been producing an average 90 mt per year. In 2011-12 the production increased a little to 115 mt, according to sources from the Sericulture Department. However there are fears of negative or stagnant results in the next crop seasons. This year’s crop production was affected by rising temperature and floods.</p>
<h2><strong>A flood of troubles in Dhemaji</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhemaji_district">Dhemaji district</a> in northern Assam is a major <em>Muga</em> growing area. About 98% of the people of the district live in the rural areas and agriculture is the principal occupation for more than 85% of the people. These families are also engaged in <em>Muga</em> cultivation. <em>Muga</em> cultivation is a labour intensive activity and almost all the family members of the household are involved in silkworm rearing, silk reeling and weaving. Unfortunately for the farmers of Dhemaji floods are destroying the basis of this industry.</p>
<p>The district has experienced recurrent floods, on an annual basis for the last few years. The Dhemaji Agriculture Department put the number of farm families affected this year at 50,500. Assam has an average <a href="http://www.jsk.gov.in/dlhs3/assam.pdf">family size of just under 5 people per family</a>, which would mean that almost 250,000 people would have been affected out of a total population of <a href="http://www.census2011.co.in/census/district/147-dhemaji.html">about 700,000.</a> A total of 3,718 hectares of agricultural land was covered in silt this year, pushing the affected people to search alternative livelihood in non-agricultural sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_41" style="width: 1030px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" class="size-full wp-image-41" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg" alt="The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)" width="1020" height="633" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-41" class="wp-caption-text">The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)</p></div>
<p>The floods and siltation have destroyed, or endangered, plantations of the Som plant, on which the <em>Muga</em> silkworms feed. The Som plantations – known as <em>Sumonis</em> – have been gradually destroyed as they have either been displaced, or their roots buried in sandy silt. Kusha Sonowal of Laomuri village, Dhemaji, said that the unavailability of good quality seeds has severely affected indigenous <em>Muga</em> rearing. Abandoning her expertise in weaving, she now helps her family run a small tea stall some 2 kilometres from her home.</p>
<h2><strong>Loss linked to change in temperature and humidity</strong></h2>
<p>Joya Duvarah, who now runs a small shop near the main road in Laomuri village, laments that her family would have earned millions if only their once prosperous <em>Muga</em> cultivation thrived. The chronic havoc of flood brought disaster and they had to cut down hectares of their Som plantations that had rotted after being submerged for months. “Apart from floods that have eaten away our <em>Sumonis</em>, a rise in temperature has brought down the production. The silkworms that are grown outside cannot bear so much heat. Vagaries of weather are responsible for premature death of worms.” she added.</p>
<p>The silkworm needs temperatures of around 30-35 degree Celsius and a humidity level of 80-85% in order to thrive. Dhemaji suffered heavy losses in <em>Muga</em> production in the last couple of years as silkworms died out due to the increase of air temperature and humidity, according to the Sericulture Department of Assam.  The current records show the annual rainfall of the district ranges from 2600 mm to 3200 mm, the relative humidity varies from 90% to 73% while the temperature varies between 39.9C in summer and 5.9C in winter. Changes in temperature and humidity lead to diseases like <a href="http://www.thethirdpole.net/2015/beth.walker/Downloads/Flacherie,%20and%20Grasserie">Flacherie</a>, and Grasserie that can wipe out an entire lot of silkworms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tocklai.net/">Tocklai Experimental Station</a>, the premier body in tea research in the state and the oldest tea research station in the world, has observed that in the last 90 there has been a <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090328/jsp/northeast/story_10728043.jsp">rise in temperature of 1.5C in many areas, and that the rainfall has decreased by 200mm on average</a>, and is now down to <a href="http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/urban/rainfall.htm">2,800mm a year</a>. Climate change compels tea cultivators to use more pesticides to kill pests and mites in their garden. This pesticide contaminates the air, and silkworms die when they breathe in the pesticides used in tea gardens nearby.</p>
<p>Though climate change has been affecting silkworms in Assam, there is no research or planning to save the glorious silk of Assam. Sources at the zonal office of the Central Silk Board in, Guwahati, the state capital, say that the board has not initiated any study on the impacts of climate change on <em>Muga</em> silk production.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For all his life, 60-year-old Abdul Rehman Dar had proudly tilled the land on his three-acre farm in the highly productive Kashmir Valley. But his work came to a sudden halt when the surging Vishu River flattened two-thirds of his village and damaged hundreds of acres of prized agricultural land in September 2014.</p>
<p>Like many others who lost nearly everything in Gund village, which lies in the southern district of Kulgam, Dar’s self-confidence has taken a beating. “All my land is under layers of mud, sand and boulders deposited by that ruthless flood,” he says, barely able to hold back tears. In a sobbing voice, he says that the loss of his farmland has shattered all his dreams.</p>
<p>After years of hard work in the fields, Dar had planned to pass the farm to his son. The region is known for its agriculture and farming was a reliable source of income that his family could rely on. Now the future is less clear.</p>
<div id="attachment_451" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-451" class="size-large wp-image-451" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/5-1024x681.jpg" alt="Farmer Abdul Rehman Dar has found it hard to recover from the loss of his land and house. Doctors have diagnosed him with depression. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)" width="760" height="505" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-1020x678.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-451" class="wp-caption-text">Farmer Abdul Rehman Dar has found it hard to recover from the loss of his land and house. Doctors have diagnosed him with depression. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>“Losing my prized land is simply the end of my life and the beginning of hardships for my family,” Dar says. “Some years back I refused to accept a job offer for my only son in the police department with the hope that he has a lot to thrive on in the form of my three-acre farm land. But, today I strongly regret that decision.” The guilt, he says, still haunts him, but police work is a dangerous job in a place like Kashmir where squads encounter pro-freedom protesters fighting to end Indian rule on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Though it’s been over a year since the floodwaters devastated his village, Dar still lives in a make-shift single room that was hastily provided by the government to house more than 50 displaced families. Lying in his bed, he spends a lot of time worrying about his family’s prospects. “Now what can my son do? He is not capable of working as a daily laborer, but then, he has no other option,” Dar says. “He has to earn for the survival of his family – his wife and two small kids.”</p>
<p>Job opportunities in the Kashmir Valley are slim. With little industry, most vacancies are offered by the government through its police and education departments. Recent years have seen massive corruption as desperate families often pay bribes to ensure slots for their sons and daughters on employment lists.</p>
<p>Dar says he could have easily bought that officer job for his son by bribing the fixer who offered the position. Now even these jobs are becoming scarce. “Today my son would have had the support of a steady monthly salary. But, while nature snatched away the land from him, I deprived him off a job,” he says regretfully.</p>
<p>Many farmers like Dar who are in similar positions have little to fall back on. According to official figures, around 135,000 hectares of agricultural land has suffered damage due to flooding over the last year in more than 100 villages in Kashmir. In many rural areas, surging waters from the tributaries of Jhelum washed away stretches of land where paddy, maize and orchards once stood.</p>

<p>Shahbaz Lone, a farmer in Sonawari-Bandipore, lost a year’s worth of crops and much of his land to the September floods, but he has yet to receive substantial assistance from the government, save a 200kg bag of rice. It has been difficult, he says, to find work as a day laborer and he had to sell off his herd of seven cattle because he could no longer afford to feed them.</p>
<p><strong>The Psychological Impact </strong></p>
<p>As the initial shock of devastation and loss wears off, those struggling to recover from extreme weather events with little help are facing long-term psychological impacts. Dar shows symptoms of depression and anxiety, and complains of many health issues. His son, Altaf Ahmad, has taken him to various doctors, but nothing so far has worked. “Most of the times he stays quiet and sometimes he breaks down all of a sudden,” Ahmad says. It’s becoming a common problem in the community as many flood victims waiting for assistance are losing hope.</p>
<p>Ahmad says that in addition to his father, other members of his family worry about how they will be able to build a new home without any resources coming in. So far, the family says it has received no substantial help from the government.</p>
<p>“The government had assured us of financial assistance for constructing our new homes, but we have only received 75,000 rupees ($1,175 USD), which is peanuts. And we don’t even have land where we can construct our houses. It won’t be free of danger to construct them again in our previous village which was ruined by the floods,” Ahmad says.</p>
<p>According to the latest official numbers—which many locals believe are purposefully understated— the floods destroyed 67,661 homes and affected the livelihoods of 30,000 people. During a recent visit to the region, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged 2,000 crore Indian rupees (approximately $303 million USD), but this falls far short of the estimated 44,000 crore rupees ($6.02 billion USD) requested shortly after the floods to reconstruct damaged infrastructure and compensate for losses suffered by the flood-hit families.</p>

<p>With little available help from the government, affected residents are struggling to find ways to restart their lives. Helplessness gives way to frustration, as many are unable to leave the makeshift accommodation they’ve been living in since the floods hit last September. With all members of the family occupying a single room, there is no privacy and schoolchildren lack separate rooms to study in. The aftermath of the floods, they say, has impacted all parts of their lives.</p>
<p>“A youth, who was engaged to a girl in a nearby village, was forced to break his relationship as the parents of his fiancée were not sure about his prospects,” a flood victim who preferred to stay anonymous said while referring to the challenges they have been confronting.</p>
<p>Concerns over livelihood and survival are starting to take their toll on the mental health of the community. Dr. Arshad Hussain, a psychiatrist in Srinagar, says that while this is a normal reaction for people whose lives are uprooted by a sudden disaster, it’s not surprising that effects are more strongly felt in Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Kashmir is already witness to one of the worst conflicts of modern times with huge human costs and a heavy toll on mental health,” he says. “Lifetime prevalence of major depression, substance use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is at all-time high in this part of the world.” If important steps such as psychological counseling and financial support to victims are delayed or not taken, Hussain says the problem can get much worse. “The economic costs of this huge mental health burden can be enormous,” he says. “The more we delay rehabilitation, more and more of them will succumb to depression. Such a scenario has to be avoided at all costs.”</p>
<p>Psychologist Roshan Ara, who has carried out research on the mental health of disaster victims, says that continuous engagement is necessary until key issues are addressed. “Soon after the floods, many non-governmental organizations started taking care of the mental health of the victims. Some of them had made arrangements for recreational activities for children in the cold season, but such an engagement should have been continued for some more time,” Ara says.</p>
<p><strong>Deepening hardships</strong></p>
<p>Trade is the predominant source of economic activity in Srinagar City, but thousands of small businesses were destroyed by the recent flood. Rafiq Rather used to support his family by selling clothes in Batmaloo, but his business, which was heavily damaged by the floodwaters, was not insured. “After the flood, I took the cloth rolls out of the shop and cleaned them for many days with the help of my wife and kids,” he says, “But, I still couldn’t get one-third of the money I had gotten them for.”</p>
<p>It’s a major economic blow. To make ends meet, Rather now sells clothes from a cart on the street. “Life has become really hard after the floods. I wonder for how long I can carry on,” he says.</p>

Mir is unable to work since he lost his home and his tools to the floods. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>Rather is not alone. According to the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation (KTMF), over 33,000 businesses suffered losses during the September 2014 floods. A majority of them were not insured against losses due to natural disasters.</p>
<p>The Jammu and Kashmir government made assurances that businesses who had suffered losses would be given financial support, but many are still waiting. “Only around 600 shopkeepers and other businessmen among 33,000 have got the financial assistance. The rest are yet to get it,” KTMF said during a recent statement.</p>
<p>Another group, the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), has questioned the manner and pace of rehabilitation process for the flood victims. “It’s ironic that only Rs 2,000 crore rupees ($303 million USD) is earmarked for rehabilitation of flood victims and out of this, only Rs 800 crore rupees ($120 million USD) are for the rehabilitation of businesses,” says KCCI’s president, Mushtaq Ahmad Wani.</p>
<p>“The government has clearly failed to meet the expectations of the flood victims in general and the small businessmen in particular. Even insurance companies have settled claims of over 2,000 crore rupees.”</p>
<p><strong>Artisans affected</strong></p>
<p>Kashmir handicrafts such as Pashima shawls, are world famous and have long been a major source of economic income, but these prized artisans were among the worst hit. Many beautiful products and studios were damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Without tools or material, local artisan Bashir Mir cannot work. “These days, I am as good as a fish out of water,” he says. “I used to get advance money and raw material from a trader for weaving the shawls. But ever since he heard that floods had washed away my tools and my house, he never met me for work.”</p>
<p>Like many of his fellow artisans, Mir—once highly sought after for his products—is now seeking employment as an unskilled laborer. Not only does he make less, but opportunities have also gone cold with the onset of winter.</p>
<div id="attachment_463" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-463" class="size-large wp-image-463" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-1024x681.jpg" alt="Women wash dishes outside their make-shift shelters (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)" width="760" height="505" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1020x678.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-463" class="wp-caption-text">Women wash dishes outside their make-shift shelters (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>“During the past week, I could work for two days only,” he says. In north Kashmir, an NGO has set up Artisan Production and Development Centers (APDCs) to aid unemployed workers, but artisans in Mir’s area have received no such support.</p>
<p>“Apart from the loss or damage in terms of products and tools, the artisan community was confronted with extreme financial hardships because they used to get advance wages,” says Yasir Qureshi, Senior Program Manager for  the Indo-Global Social Service Society (IGSSS). “We have set up 13 such centers and are also providing material support to the artisans for weaving of carpets. Entire amount earned by selling the product goes to the artisans.”</p>
<p>A year on, thousands of farmers, traders and skilled laborers are still waiting for the government to come out with a comprehensive plan to revive their shattered economy. In the meantime, communities are attempting to move forward. Taxi driver Bilal Ahmad Koka, who lost both of his cabs to the floods, says he was lucky they were insured. “Otherwise, today I would be also one of those wanting the government to do something for me,” Koka says. One beneficiary of the recent disasters, local insurance companies claim to have seen a 500 percent increase in new policies. “Following the floods, businessmen are insuring businesses against full value and are quite willing to pay high premiums,” says Imtiyaz Ahmad, who works for an Indian insurance company in Kashmir. But tougher regulations on agricultural businesses are preventing farmers from</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With dreams of becoming Nigeria’s &#8220;Lionel Messi,&#8221; 15-year-old Sanni Usman watches the famous footballer’s every match and trains every day in his village’s football field to sharpen his skills. But it seems his dream may be in jeopardy as his playing field could soon be gone. A stretch of gully erosion that has cut off his village road to the main town of Katsina State has started to redirect towards the community football field.</p>
<p>Bindawa is one of several local governments threatened by massive gully erosion in states across the northwest region of Nigeria. What started as a small crack on the road some five years ago has finally cut off Kaita village from Katsina/Kano highway. And many say changing weather patterns are to blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rains come late and don&#8217;t last for long. They are heavy, causing floods and devastating the land,” said Alhaji Ibrahim Dalhatu, the head of the local government administration in Bindawa. “As the rain moves it creates its own channels that end up breaking the soil and widen them as trenches. It started gradually but now many parts of our lands are devastated and can barely be used for agricultural purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Usman knows something is wrong but can&#8217;t explain why every year the short and heavy rain that falls in his village continues to leave large holes where the water flows. &#8220;Some years ago an access road connected my village with the highway but gradually the road was cut off. I find it hard to believe that vehicles no longer pass through my village. Especially on market days in neighboring Charanchi town, where many people travel to trade. This is now a once upon a time story because look at the road it is no longer accessible,&#8221; he said pointing dejectedly at the ground. &#8220;My fear now is that this field I come to train daily, may soon go the way of our access road.”</p>
<p>Land degradation such as gully erosion threatens to displace thousands of people in Katsina State, but could have been mitigated if the Great Green Wall project was implemented by the Nigerian government. The African Union proposed this project as a measure to combat desert encroachment in the Sahel region of Africa over a decade ago in Njamena, Chad. It involves the planting of shelter belt trees that would combat desert creep and boost the quality of the soil, as well as economic activities in the affected areas. The project involves eleven countries from Senegal in West Africa to Djibouti in East Africa.</p>
<p>Usman believes the changing rain patterns are destroying the soils of Kaita. &#8220;After last year’s rainy season, we noticed the soil became lose and cracks appeared on the ground. The land towards our field started breaking slowly, then we decided to move a bit farther from the approaching trenches. If something is not done about this trench, we may no longer have a football field to train on.”</p>

<p>Katsina receives an annual rainfall of less than one meter between early April and July. Sometimes the rainy season extends further to September. During much of this time, the rainfall is irregular and heavy, running off rather than absorbing into the dry soil. The lack of drainage channels along roads is also increasing the incidence of gully erosion. When it rains, the water always create a new channel, which becomes one of many gullies that have devastated the land in parts of Katsina State.</p>
<p>In 2013, the road between Katsina and Kano was reconstructed after collapsing during a heavy downpour. A connecting bridge was also constructed to link the road, but environmental advocate Shehu Lawal believes it may collapse in a couple of years. Construction of a bridge is not the solution, he says, the focus should instead be on creating drainage channels that can funnel excess rain and help reduce gully erosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the roads are constructed without drainage. This will surely leads to the roads been eroded. Water will always look for a channel,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Who can farm around a gully?<br />
</strong><br />
Katsina is one of the states in northern Nigeria that is affected by desert encroachment and resulting gully erosion. Many people in villages across the state are losing their lands and access roads. A massive gully along the Katsina/Kano road is especially hazardous for nighttime drivers.</p>
<p>Lawal believes that the state government needs to do more to protect the environment. &#8220;During the administration of Musa Yar&#8217;Adua [the former governor of Katsina State], many trees were planted to protect the soil, but the subsequent administration didn&#8217;t take tree planting [seriously],” he said. “In the border communities with the desert, our farmers can&#8217;t use the land. Do you know that some farmers now move to other villages to farm because of desert encroachment and these gullies? Who can farm around a gully? It is a death trap.”</p>
<p>In the local government area of Charanchi, the community primary school is surrounded by large gully trenches, which head teacher Ibrahim Ladan calls “a threat.” &#8220;This school has a population of about 600 pupils. We serve the whole community and want to build more classrooms, but there is no land to build on. The gully erosion is advancing closer to our classrooms. If nothing is done we might lose parts of this school,” he said. “We have written to the state government but nothing is yet to be done…It is a death trap but we don&#8217;t have a place where we can put our students except here.”</p>
<p>It’s an especially severe blow to Katsina State—one of the poorest in the country—which already suffers from extremely low enrollment levels. Katsina State official Hussaini Dangari said the government is attempting to teach people on the need to protect the environment and prevent such side effects as the creeping gullies through advocacy and education programs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Katsina State is the highest beneficiary of the Great Green Wall project in Nigeria,” said Dangari, Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Environment. “The shelter belt is planted across ten local governments in the frontline areas impacted by desert encroachment. Between 2013 till now, 47 kilometers of shelter belts have been planted under the Great Green Wall project in Katsina State.&#8221;</p>
<p>In October 2015, 925 million naira designated for the Great Green Wall project was recovered after being fraudulently diverted from the Federal Ministry of the Environment. This came after various investigations were carried out by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission, Nigeria&#8217;s anti-corruption agency. Coupled with the fact that Nigeria elected not send a representative to the Third African Ministerial Conference on the project a year earlier, environmental experts are questioning Nigeria’s commitment to actual implementation of the Great Great Wall Initiative.</p>
<p>A visit to the border with the Niger Republic turned up few shelter belt trees. N&#8217;Goual Djoumaye village, which sits in both Nigeria and Niger shows visible signs of desert encroachment. Moahmed Abubakar, leader of the village’s Nigerian side, said no tree has been planted in the community under the Great Green Wall project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The desert starts becoming visible from mid-December. This green (sparsely grown nerdy shrubs) you are seeing now will disappear. The trees you can see now we&#8217;re planted by us. There is not one tree planted by the Great Green Wall here,” he said. “Even though we are affected by desertification, the impacts have gotten so bad that before we could harvest an average of 10 bundles of millet but now we barely harvest 2 bundles.”</p>
<p>Instead of trees, the only sign of the project is a rusted board baring a Great Green Wall logo mounted on a pole. A fenced area close by was meant to be a nursery for the new trees, but the space is deserted. According to Ministry of Environment officials, Katsina State is supposed to be the highest beneficiary of the project.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[While the predicted impacts of climate change and environmental degradation are dire, it is important to note that the futures of Morocco and other countries embattled by climate change are not set in stone. The actions of polluting countries at COP 21 and in the future can go a long way to alleviating these problems.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The Sahara moves northwards</strong></h2>
<p>In 2011, a storm near Agoudim, Morocco triggered a large flood that swept down the mountain towards a small, Berber village. The river overflowed its banks and caused chaos in town: all crops near the river were lost; the only road into Agoudim suffered so much damage that it was permanently closed, and many houses were completely flooded. Despite the great personal impacts from the flood, people were most distraught about the damage to the mosque, the spiritual center of the community. Four years after, the destruction wrought by the flood sticks in the collective memory of the town as a danger of environmental change.</p>
<div id="attachment_90" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC02813.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-90" class="wp-image-90 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC02813-1024x768.jpg" alt="Aftermath of 2011 floods in Agoudim (Credit: Hassein Ouzayd)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC02813-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC02813-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-90" class="wp-caption-text">Aftermath of 2011 floods in Agoudim (Credit: Hassein Ouzayd)</p></div>
<p>It may be counter intuitive, but increased flooding is a symptom of desertification and the slow creep of the Sahara Desert. When it rains in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the lack of topsoil means that water runs straight into rivers. Hassein Ouzayd, a resident of Agoudim, told me that overgrazing and the harvest of firewood caused the devastating floods, but increased flooding is also connected to global climate change, which disproportionately impacts the world’s poorest.</p>
<p>Flooding is just one way that desertification threatens the livelihoods of rural Moroccans. Agriculture, which provides <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/business/2014/08/httpalhayatcomopinionwriters4332931-.html">44% of labor opportunities</a> and <a href="http://www.maroc.ma/en/content/green-morocoo-plan">generates 19% of GDP</a> in the country, is most at risk. Access to firewood and water are also at risk.</p>
<p>Unaddressed, these issues will diminish the quality of life in rural Morocco. Even more troubling is that experts expect climate change to make these problems worse by reducing precipitation and increasing temperature. The line between old problems caused by environmental degradation and new problems caused by global climate change is blurry, but all signs point to big changes for Moroccans, especially for poor farmers. As a Peace Corps volunteer in Agoudim from 2008-2010, I came back to Morocco in 2015 to see how environmental degradation is affecting the <em>Amazigh </em>culture.</p>
<h2><strong>The <em>Amazigh</em></strong></h2>
<p>The problems currently facing Morocco have roots in the history and culture of the country. The <em>Amazigh</em> – Berbers – migrated to Northern Africa before 10,000 B.C. Although much of Morocco has adopted Arab identity, the <em>Amazigh</em> maintain a unique language and culture in parts of the country. Rural areas – especially areas around the Rif Mountains, the Middle, High, and anti-Atlas Mountains, and near the Sahara – have resisted Arabization. The <em>Amazigh</em> are a fiercely independent people that have long fought against outside rule. Much of the “Arab Spring” protests in Morocco <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14650257">centered around an <em>Amazigh</em> independence movement</a>.</p>
<p>One way that the <em>Amazigh</em> have adopted Arab culture by is embracing Islam. In the marginalized areas where the <em>Amazigh</em> live, people tend to be socially conservative. Islam plays a central role in most people’s lives. It’s no surprise that damage to the mosque in Agoudim was so traumatic.</p>
<p>Many Moroccans regard the <em>Amazigh</em> as uneducated and poor. The word “Berber” itself has a derogatory origin, meaning barbarian in Greek and Roman. Approximately 40-45% of Moroccans <a href="http://www.al-bab.com/arab/background/berber.htm">identify as <em>Amazigh</em></a> and <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/05/01/the-berber-awakening/">speak a <em>Tamazight</em> dialect</a>, but many more have <em>Amazigh</em> ancestry. As Morocco modernizes and many Moroccans leave rural areas, younger generations speak less and less <em>Tamazight</em>, learning the more cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and French.</p>
<p>Travelling in Arab cities as a foreign, <em>Tamazight</em> speaker reveals an interesting relationship between Arabs and the <em>Amazigh</em>. Vendors and tour guides are quick to talk up their <em>Amazigh</em> roots and exotify the culture for the benefit of tourists. But many urban Moroccans told me that the <em>Tamazight</em> language I learned was the language of a backward people; their disdain for the <em>Amazigh </em>was easy to hear and feel.</p>
<p><em>Amazigh</em> areas have undergone a rapid transformation in the last twenty years. Small villages like Agoudim that were nearly completely isolated have gained electricity, cellphone service, improved access to healthcare and education, and roads that connect them with the outside world.</p>
<div id="attachment_95" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC04051.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95" class="wp-image-95 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC04051-1024x683.jpg" alt="Town in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Duncan Gromko)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04051-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04051-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95" class="wp-caption-text">Town in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Duncan Gromko)</p></div>
<p>Despite this development, <em>Amazigh</em> areas remain the most marginalized in Morocco, with local economies based on semi-subsistence agriculture, pastoralism, and moderate income from tourism. According to Dr. Korbinian Freier, an environmental scientist with the Research Unit Sustainability and Global Change at the University of Hamburg, 30% of people in Southern Morocco regard herding of goats and sheep as their primary source of income. Herders walk their animals dozens and dozens of miles, often staying out weeks at a time.</p>
<p>I once walked to the top of a nearby mountain ridge; at 10,000 feet, it is about 4,000 feet above Agoudim. After three hours of hard hiking, I was amazed to find three young men from my village at the top of the mountain. They take their herds to the summit in order to eat the melting snow, which is one of the few sources of water in the summer. Herding has always been hard, but now young men walk harder to find food and water for their animals.</p>
<div id="attachment_102" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/P1040239.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-102" class="size-large wp-image-102" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/P1040239-1024x768.jpg" alt="Goats in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Driss Ouabess) " width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P1040239-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P1040239-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-102" class="wp-caption-text">Goats in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Driss Ouabess)</p></div>
<p>Some communities are still semi-nomadic, moving between high mountains in summer and the desert plains in winter. Dr. Ismail Ouraich, an agricultural research from Goulmima, Morocco, said that sheep and goats are more important than just the income they generate: “[People] use livestock as bank accounts. If you have leftover, you invest it in your herd. And if you need the money, you bring the goat to the butcher for money.”</p>
<h2><strong>Environmental changes hurt the people</strong></h2>
<p>On the fringes of the Sahara Desert, Moroccan agriculture has always faced challenges of poor soil quality and little precipitation. Population and economic growth have put increased pressure on a vulnerable environment. Extensive grazing, the expansion of agriculture, and deforestation have degraded soil cover, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/261474223_A_review_of_Available_Knowledge_on_land_Degradation_in_Morocco._In_ICARDA_(eds)._Morocco._OASIS_Contry_Report_2">leading to erosion and the loss of soil fertility</a>. The Rif Mountains, for instance, have one of the highest rates of erosion in the world.</p>
<p>Energy for cooking and heating primarily comes from wood harvested from nearby forests. Mountainous areas are surprisingly cold in the winter, with individual snowstorms covering the ground in more than one foot of snow. Wood stoves are the primary means of staying warm in this frigid environment. I spent one winter night in Taararte in Midelt Province, where hillsides have been completely deforested. The family I stayed with was the wealthiest in the village and was fortunate enough to be able to buy wood driven in by trucks. Most people had to shiver around fires fueled by small bushes.</p>
<p>Each day in Agoudim, a steady stream of people on donkeys and mule exit the town, in search of firewood. A local, middle-aged woman, Ziniba*, – told me that it takes her several hours to collect wood. Women and girls are primarily responsible for wood collection and this is a huge drain on their time. Ziniba said, “I have to walk farther to cut wood now than when I first came to Agoudim [nearly 20 years ago]. I get home, I’m tired, I don’t have time to milk the cow or talk to my friends before I have to cook dinner.”</p>
<div id="attachment_89" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Dc-1051.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89" class="size-large wp-image-89" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Dc-1051-1024x768.jpg" alt="Young man walking home after cutting wood (Credit: Duncan Gromko)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dc-1051-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dc-1051-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-89" class="wp-caption-text">Young man walking home after cutting wood (Credit: Duncan Gromko)</p></div>
<p>Without ground cover, rainwater runs immediately into rivers and floodplains, creating flash floods. Destructive floods are increasingly common in Morocco; <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/morocco-flash-flood-leaves-dozens-dead-201411243953753114.html">a flash flood</a> in 2014 killed 31 people.</p>
<p>These challenges, driven by population and economic growth, are already changing life in rural Morocco. Experts predict that climate change will exacerbate these problems, fueling the northward march of the Sahara. <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/257015529_Climate_change_vulnerability_and_adaptation_in_North_Africa_with_focus_on_Morocco">According to Dr. Janpeter Schilling</a> of the University of Hamburg, precipitation could decline by as much as 20% by 2050. At the same time, temperatures are likely to rise by two to three degrees Centigrade.</p>
<p>These changing climactic conditions could lower agriculture productivity in the region by 30-40%. Small farmers will be hurt the most because they are more dependent on seasonal weather. <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/climate-change-impacts-moroccan-agriculture-and-whole-economy">As Dr. Ouraich explains</a>, “The sector is dependent on rainfall, especially small and medium farmers, specifically with cereal crops. This problem is structural in Morocco, we’re still struggling to modernize the sector in order to reduce reliance on weather effects.”</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ouraich, the resulting food price increases will have the biggest impact on poor Moroccans. Surprisingly, many farmers are actually net buyers of food, meaning that increasing prices will hurt them.</p>
<h2><strong>Possible solutions</strong></h2>
<p>Major polluting countries shoulder major responsibility for climate change and its resulting impacts on countries like Morocco. The negotiations this year in Paris at the Conference of Parties is an opportunity for these countries to commit to change course through legally binding emissions reduction. Should pollution levels continue to rise along their predicted trajectory, however, experts are considering a number ways for Morocco to adapt to these changing conditions, including increased temperatures and low water supply.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Moroccan government launched the <em>Plan Maroc Vert</em> – Green Morocco Plan – to modernize agriculture in the country by improving productivity and resource efficiency in agriculture. Pillar One of the Plan works with larger farmers to improve farming input use, while Pillar Two focuses on working with small farmers in marginal areas by helping them switch to higher value, drought-resistant crops, such as olives. According to Dr. Gabriella Izzi, the Team Leader for the World Bank’s support for agriculture in Morocco, many of the changes will improve farmers’ resilience to climate change by better managing water use and switching to more resilient crops. Additionally, the Plan’s investments are reducing soil erosion by helping farmers switch to no-till farming methods. As of 2014, Pillar Two of the Plan has reached 722,000 farmers.</p>
<div id="attachment_94" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC04021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94" class="size-large wp-image-94" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC04021-1024x683.jpg" alt="Fields in Agoudim (Credit: Duncan Gromko)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04021-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04021-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94" class="wp-caption-text">Fields in Agoudim (Credit: Duncan Gromko)</p></div>
<p>Despite some successes, the Moroccan Government faces a challenge to reach the small farmers who will be most affected by climate change because they are not credit-worthy. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable farmers are unable to borrow from banks that channel the Plan’s investments. Additionally, the Plan only works indirectly on issues related to herding and soil degradation.</p>
<p>Community leaders in Agoudim are skeptical about such government initiatives because previous efforts never turn out as promised. When I first arrived in 2008, there was a plan to build a community center to train people on carpet-weaving techniques and computer literacy. Two years later, the building was only half finished. When I came back to Agoudim in 2015, I was excited to see that the building was completed. To this day, however, it has been locked, shuttered, and has never hosted any of the promised activities.</p>
<p>There are small-scale projects that target pastoralism. As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco from 2011-2013, Sara del Fierro worked on a project in collaboration with the Moroccan High Commission on Water and Forests, a local development association, a nearby National Park, and local government to reduce erosion, flooding, and landslides by stabilizing river banks and reforestation. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled because of differences between the various groups.</p>
<p>Sara wrote, “I think there&#8217;s a strong sense of grassroots community organization and entrepreneurialism in Morocco, which gives it a great context for projects to thrive in. Almost every village near [my site] in the High Atlas had some sort of local organization&#8230;But introducing these kind of external projects inevitably changes the dynamic.  Questions come up: Who would be the first (pilot) site? Who gets what resources? Who decides who gets these resources?” Competition for scarce resources from international organizations can sour a project and ultimately enrich the most powerful players.</p>
<p>Another Peace Corps volunteer (2008-2010), Logan Sander, worked on a project supported by the United States Agency for International Development to introduce more efficient woodstoves in an effort to reduce deforestation from firewood collection. According to Dr. Korbinian’s research, if firewood collection were eliminated, the soil conservation benefits would be high enough to offset losses from climate change in some areas. Despite two years of work, Logan was only able to convince one business to switch to an efficient woodstove. Accustomed to their traditional stoves, people were skeptical of a foreign technology pushed by an American.</p>
<p>Changing engrained behavior in rural areas represents an enormous challenge, especially in the case of publicly owned environmental resources. Dr. Ouraich says, “It’s a collective action problem, it’s the tragedy of the commons&#8230;Nobody has the incentive to do something about it. People are smart, they’re not stupid, and they see that the cost of doing something is really high.” Hassein told me that, although people recognize the source of the problem, sheepherders are unwilling to reduce the size of their herds because they have no other way to make money.</p>
<p>Driss Ouabess, a resident of Agoudim, started a small hotel and guide service in an effort to diversify his income. If people can make money from sources that don’t degrade the land, it will reduce pressure on the environment. The hotel is growing in popularity, but in an isolated place like Agoudim, Driss is unable to attract enough tourists in order to stop farming.</p>
<p>Whether or not these small-scale efforts are effective, it is important to remember the enormity of the problem and that nothing less than economic revolution is required to reduce Morocco’s susceptibility to climate change.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Will Morocco be the same?</strong></h2>
<p>Walking the dusty streets of Agoudim for the first time since 2010 was an emotional experience. The changes like the 2011 flood are just the tip of the iceberg. The <em>Amazigh</em> have been living in the Atlas Mountains for millennia. They are a resilient people who have fought back against invading armies, but I wonder how much more they can withstand, while remaining who they are and maintaining their way of life. I admired the beauty of this place and these people, but I am afraid for their future. I know that there is no time to lose when it comes to climate action.</p>
<p>The most likely climate change adaptation strategy is not one managed centrally by the Moroccan government or supported by environmental projects, but a collection of choices made by individual Moroccans to protect their livelihoods. These choices will affect <em>Amazigh</em> traditions and a way of life that has existed for millennia. Rural Moroccans are resourceful and have always dealt with harsh climatic conditions, but climate change will test their resiliency.</p>

<p>The <em>Amazigh</em> and other North Africans will look northwards, to Europe, to escape the advancing Sahara Desert. Dr. Korbinian says, “Europe is already overwhelmed by the refugees from Syria. If climate change has a large impact and people are free to choose, this refugee wave will increase.” Will Europe and other major polluting regions invest now in order to avoid this climate catastrophe? Or will they delay and pay a different price later?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As winter tightens its grip over Pakistan’s Kalash valleys, home to the ancient Kalash tribe, many parts of the mountain region are still struggling to repair the damage wrought by the floods this monsoon</em></p>
<p>“You won’t recognize Bumburet Valley when we get there,” my driver informed me as we navigated through streams and attempted to cross broken roads that were washed away by the devastating floods that hit Chitral District in July and August of this year. One now needs a four-wheel drive to reach the Kalash Valleys – a harrowing 2 hour drive from Chitral town, which sits along the border with the Afghan province of Nuristan.</p>

<p>The three Kalash valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir are encircled by high mountains, a natural barrier from Nuristan whose people were converted to Islam in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by an Afghan king. The Kalasha are an ancient tribe, the last survivors of Kafiristan (of which Nuristan was once a part), and their pre-Islamic religion is focused on their environment: although they worship a creator called “Desau”, they also believe that trees, stones and streams all have souls.</p>
<p>A narrow road used to lead into Bumburet, the largest of the three valleys. Only recently re-opened, it’s now strewn with large boulders brought down by the floodwaters. Vehicles must cut through agricultural fields and crisscross the main <em>nullah</em> – or riverbed – just to get to its villages. Near the valley’s entrance, we passed a badly damaged government primary school. Here children must study in tents along the side of the road.</p>
<p>The nearby Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation Motel is also in ruins. A gushing stream that used the surround the property turned into a surging river as floodwaters came rushing down the mountains and into the Bumburet valley, destroying its wooden chalets and large garden.</p>
<p>The rest of the valley’s main town was also badly hit. Once a popular tourist destination, the big hotels all suffered major damage, as did countless shops, around two dozen houses, many orchards, fields and of course the main road itself.</p>

<p>“I would say the floods were a result of all the deforestation that has taken place in these valleys in recent years, just look at the bare mountain sides – and of course climate change was also responsible. It is almost the end of September now and it is still warm; in earlier years the summer would end in August when we would celebrate our autumn festival,” explains Akram Hussain, a Kalash man who is in charge of the Kalasha Cultural Centre built by the Greek government in 2004, which is thankfully still intact.</p>
<p>The Centre houses an impressive museum, community center and educational facilities for the Kalash people. In the museum, one can find a large collection of Kalasha antiques like old jewelry, cooking utensils, sculptures of horses, rugs and costumes. The Kalasha women still wear their traditional dress, an embroidered black frock tied at the waist by a belt or sash.</p>
<p>Strong stone walls built around the Centre by Greek volunteers ultimately saved it from the forceful impact of the floods. “The high walls withstood the floodwaters, which came rushing down from the mountains at one end of the valley and went around the building,” says Hussain. Sadly, it’s likely to be the last bit of sizeable aid the Kalasha will receive from the Greek government, which continues to pay for teachers and school supplies at the Cultural Centre, but is now facing severe economic problems at home.</p>
<p>The Greeks believe that the Kalasha are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army, which marched through the Hindu Kush Mountains centuries ago. Indeed, last year a team of geneticists led by Oxford University sampled genomes from around the world and found that the Kalash people of Pakistan have chunks of DNA from an ancient European population.</p>

<p>Today, only 4,114 Kalasha remain according to a census conducted in July 2014, but there have been many conversions to Islam as more outsiders settle into the Kalash Valleys, often building homes near the main road. Around 1,800 Kalasha live in Bumburet, but higher up along the sides of the valley.</p>
<p>“Our culture was already under threat, and now these floods have destroyed our crops and orchards. We will have to buy food from the bazaar and store it if we are to survive this winter. Luckily, there was no loss of lives in Bumburet because we got a call from the border police which jointly patrols the border with the army. They called us over our mobile phones to warn us that the flood was coming,” says Hussain. “I called people living near the Bumburet <em>nullah</em> (the mountain stream that runs through the valley floor) and told them to get out.”</p>
<p>Hussain tells us there were two major floods in Bumburet in July and a smaller one in August. “The second flood in July that lasted for two days caused the most damage. We have never seen floods like this in the Kalash valleys before. I would say that at least half of Bumburet Valley was destroyed or damaged by these floods.”</p>
<p>Despite the widespread destruction, only four of the 22 houses swept away belonged to Kalash families. “Our houses are mostly built higher up and all the people living below ran up to our homes,” explains Shaheen Gul, a young Kalash woman living in Krakal Village in Bumburet. “But our fields with corn and beans that were ready for harvest and fruit trees like walnuts and apricots are gone as they were near the <em>nullah</em>.”</p>
<p>Krakal Village is one of the oldest settlements in Bumburet, built high above the main road. While the Kalasha’s traditional wooden homes are well-built and extremely tough, Gul says it was a terrifying night for all involved. “We could hear the flood before it arrived – we were so scared by the roaring sound in the middle of the night. Then the earth started shaking as if there was an earthquake. It was raining very hard that night,” she recalls. “Later when we came down we saw all the destruction – these floods were definitely much worse than the 2010 floods.”</p>

<p>The soldiers patrolling the border with Afghanistan say that melting glaciers also played a role in the recent floods. “There are around four glaciers high up above in these mountains overlooking Bumburet,” explains Shair Shah, a member of the Chitral Levies border force. “Glacial floods came down along with the rain water, that is why there were so many large boulders and we even saw large chunks of black ice.”</p>
<p>Syed Harir Shah, a disaster risk reduction expert from Chitral, feels that torrential rainfall was the main cause of the flooding, “The shifting of the monsoon further west to Chitral is a highly unusual event,” he says. “It needs to be researched. How did it shift? Why was no proper warning given to the people of Chitral?”</p>
<p>National climate change expert Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry blames the erratic monsoon weather this year on El Niño, a periodic warming of the ocean along the equatorial Pacific that impacts weather patterns. “[El Niño] contributed to the abruptness of the monsoon this summer. Some monsoon currents penetrated into the Hindu Kush mountain range, an area which generally lies outside the monsoon belt,” says the former head of Pakistan’s Meteorological Department. “The persistent rainfall accelerated snow melting and triggered both floods and the outbursts of glacial lakes.”</p>
<p>His explanation reflects what eyewitnesses in Rumbur Valley – the second area to be badly affected by the flooding – have reported. The third Kalash valley of Birir was not damaged by the floodwaters.</p>
<p>“The floods started on the 13<sup>th</sup> of July and we had almost continuous flooding until the 5<sup>th</sup> of August. We had rainfall almost every day. There were two types of floods – one was a glacier flood in the Rumbur <em>Nullah</em> and the other was flash floods coming down one of the mountain sides,” says Mohammed Iqbal, a Kalash social worker with the Pakistan Red Crescent Society. “The water flooded into the Jestak temple (dedicated to the deity that protects family) in Balanguru village, but luckily it was not badly damaged.”</p>
<p>According to Iqbal, a survey of the valley found that around 34 houses in Rumbur were damaged or destroyed by the floods, but an early mobile alert from shepherds high up in the mountains prevented any loss of life in the valley. “The shepherds told us that they saw cloudbursts over the Gangalurat glacier on the boundary with Nuristan which then burst,” he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="size-full wp-image-159" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg" alt="Damaged homes near the river (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg 960w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Damaged homes near the river (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>The floods brought down boulders, trees and whatever else was in their way, destroying orchards, fields, water channels and roads. Today the road to Rumbur Valley – an hour’s drive from the larger Bumburet Valley – is barely open. At a certain point, one must travel by foot to the villages beyond a bridge that has miraculously survived.</p>
<p>“I think there were around 40 to 50 floods here this summer – in 2010 (a year of widespread flooding throughout Pakistan) there was just one big flood,” explains Iqbal as we walk a path to the valley that eventually disappears, having been swept away by the flood in the <em>nullah</em>.</p>
<p>The Kalash people living higher up in the Rumbur Valley have to literally cling to the cliff wall above the <em>nullah. </em>Precarious wooden planks wedged into the mountainside provide a rickety path to the main village where shops are located. There are no big hotels here, just a few guesthouses where tourists can stay overnight. Locals say the re-opening of the road to the valley in late September brought an end to a worsening food crisis, at least for now.</p>
<p>“We were confined to the houses located further up on the mountain sides and we ran out of food,” recalls Iqbal. “We had to rely on the army helicopters who dropped wheat and other rations during the floods.” Luckily, their mobile phones were still working so they could alert the outside world.</p>

<p>“The noise of the floods was deafening. The children are still so traumatized. Every time it rains now they start crying and saying ‘a flood is coming,’” says Naseem, a Kalash woman who lives in Grum Village at the entrance to the Rumbur Valley. She says with winter approaching they will be facing some hard times.</p>
<p>“All our crops with potatoes, beans and sorghum near the <em>nullah</em> are gone along with so many fruit trees,” she says. “The drinking water supply has not been restored and the women have to go down to the <em>nullah</em> daily to fetch water and carry it up in large vessels. The children and elderly are starting to get waterborne diseases and falling sick. The electricity has not been restored either.” A micro-hydro plant used to provide electricity to Rumbur Valley, but was damaged by the floods. The community plans to fix it before winter. The main water pipeline was also damaged and the local people are urging the government to restore it.</p>
<p>“For now the people who lost their homes are living with relatives, but that will put a strain on everyone over the long winter months when the valley is cut off by snow and we can’t buy supplies from the outside. In November, the snow starts to fall and roads are closed for almost four months,” says Quaid-e-Azam, a Kalash man who works for a hotel in Chitral town. “However, I have heard that the World Food Programme is planning to give food to the Kalash Valleys for the four winter months.”</p>
<p>Despite the obvious hardships, the Kalasha people remain quite resilient. They even celebrated their annual Uchaw Festival in late August. “Uchaw commemorates the harvest,” explains Azam, “and we celebrated it…despite all the destruction. This is a religious festival and we have to continue with our culture and rituals.”</p>
<p>But he worries about the future. “The floods are becoming worse each year…we have to plan now for future floods. Today because of the growing population in the Kalash valleys people have no choice but to build near the <em>nullah,</em> but they are risking their lives. They only got saved this time because of the mobile phone warning. They were extremely lucky.”</p>

<p>Some Kalash villagers fear their deities are angry with them for the widespread environmental damage that has taken place in their ancestral homeland. “We feel the floods are coming as they are cursing us people for all this deforestation and destruction of their habitat,” says Zarin Khan, a Kalash man who works for the government’s Tourism Corporation in Chitral town. “Trees and entire forests have been cut down for both construction and firewood purposes, the animals living up in the mountains have no pine nuts to eat and even the birds go hungry.”</p>
<p>During the Uchaw festival, Kalash elders prayed to the creator Desau to save the people from future floods. But according to Azam, the torrential rainfall was so severe that the flooding even affected parts of Chitral where little deforestation is taking place. &#8220;The floods occurred in places like Reshun and Brepp were there are historically no forests. No one is safe now with all this climate change,” he says from behind the reception desk at the hotel he works at in Chitral town. &#8220;I&#8217;m very worried, the next few years are going to be very hard for us. We can only hope to survive with better planning.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jordan Valley, which encompasses modern day Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, has long been considered the region’s food basket. But the once cascading waters of the Jordan River – the lifeblood of its fertile grounds – have been reduced in many places to a mere trickle, victim of transboundary squabbling over water rights that is devastating the traditional livelihoods of the region’s Palestinian farmers.</p>
<p>Now it’s climate change that is exacting a heavy toll.</p>
<p>Captured by the Israelis from Jordan in 1967, the valley has become a central issue in recent peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. To Israel, it’s as a critical piece of their defense and intelligence capabilities, while many Palestinians say the occupation isn’t about security, but access to resources. According to World Bank estimates, tight Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to agricultural land and water resources in the Jordan Valley is costing the Palestinian economy more than $700 million per year.</p>
<p>But historically low rainfall rates and warming temperatures are placing additional pressure on disputed water resources. In recent years, dozens of aquifers have dried up and many fear the Jordan Valley, which lies 100 to 450 meters below sea level, will turn into an arid desert if water is eventually depleted.</p>
<div id="attachment_370" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-370" class="size-full wp-image-370" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-2.jpg" alt="The barren village of Fayasel in the Jordan Valley (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-370" class="wp-caption-text">The barren village of Fasayel in the Jordan Valley (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>According to a recent report issued by the Palestinian Environmental Center, this past summer was the hottest in decades. Temperatures rose 10 degrees Celsius over monthly averages in Jericho and other parts of the Jordan Valley, in some cases surpassing 50ºC (about 122ºF).</p>
<p>For the valley’s Palestinian farmers, water is already a scarce commodity. Many say there is often not enough water for basic necessities, let alone enough for their livestock or to practice traditional year-round cultivation.</p>
<p>“About 20 years ago, agriculture flourished in my village and we were self-sufficient,” says Mahmoud Saleh Suleiman, a 64-year-old farmer. “But during the past few years, water started to gradually dry up for many reasons.” One of those reasons, he believes, is climate change. “Especially in summer,” he says, “the temperature has increased, drying up water aquifers.”</p>
<p>The head of the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, Adalah Atiri, says that prevailing drought conditions are having a major impact in the West Bank, in turn affecting the food and agricultural sector. “We assume the worst possibilities to enable us to tackle issues such as a fall in rainfall of 10-20 percent by 2020 as a result of climate change,” Atiri says, “Work is needed to find solutions and adapt to these changes.”</p>
<h2>Challenging political environment</h2>
<p>But any solutions that ignore the complex political realities on the ground are insufficient.</p>
<p>Approximately 80,000 Palestinians live in the Jordan Valley, but strict Israeli measures restrict them from accessing 94 percent of available land, according to a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. Instead, Israel has allocated the majority of the valley’s land, about 86 percent, to regional councils who protect the interests of its 9,500 Israeli settlers. According to World Bank estimates, each settler receives an average of 300 liters per capita per day, about four times the amount available to Palestinians across the West Bank.</p>
<p>Villages that used to sustainably produce crops have seen their once abundant supplies of water dry up, much of it diverted to the nearby farms of Israeli settlers. Wells are often antiquated and in desperate need of repair, but it’s difficult to get the necessary permits to fix them as many lie in Area C – a security zone where Israel maintains full control.</p>
<p>In Suleiman’s hometown of Fasayel, more than 95 percent of the village’s 2,000 residents are farmers, but due to chronic water shortages, local agricultural production has ceased completely. Many now work for Israeli farms along the outskirts of the town, an industry that has been sharply criticized by human rights groups for labor violations.</p>
<p>“While the village population has doubled during the last twenty years,” Suleiman says, “our share of water has remained the same and we are obliged to buy water to meet our daily needs, as well as needs for cultivation.” But this resource comes at a steep price.</p>

<p>Dr. Abdel Rahman Tamimi, director of the Palestinian Hydology Group, says that continuous reductions in water supplies have forced Palestinians to buy water from the Israeli authorities at inflated prices. The price of one cubic meter of treated water is 5 shekels, Tamimi says, “but the Israelis take advantage of Palestinian demand for water and sell it at 25 shekels for one cubic meter, especially in Hebron and the Jordan Valley area, where people spend around 12 percent of their monthly income on water.”</p>
<p>According to Tamimi, factors such as climate change and Israeli control over supply have restricted daily individual consumption from an average of 80 liters to only 40. In some cases it’s much less, but each is below the 100 liters per day recommended by the World Health Organization. “In southern Hebron,” he says, “the per capita share of water is only 10 liters and people in that area are obliged to buy water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmer Youself Sawafta owns several <em>dunums </em>of land in Bardala (each <em>dunum </em>is equal to 100 square meters), the lowest agricultural strip on earth. The last three years, he says, have been some of the most difficult due to the adverse effects of hot weather on agriculture and water supplies. Despite his best efforts to reduce reliance on water-intensive crops, his output remains meager. “For more than a year, we have been trying to cultivate crops that do not need much water, such as barley,” he says. “We barely have sufficient water for our daily use, let alone cultivation.”</p>
<p>Sawafta says that tight restrictions on what little water is available for agriculture only makes things worse. “In the past, we were allowed to extract 400 cubic meters per hour,” he says. “The occupation allocated us only 80 cubic meters per hour, which is insufficient to cultivate any type of vegetable.”</p>
<div id="attachment_386" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/7-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386" class="size-full wp-image-386" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/7-5.jpg" alt="A well in Bardah that is controlled by the Israeli water company Makarot (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-386" class="wp-caption-text">A well in Bardalah that is controlled by the Israeli water company Mekorot (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>What does remain is cost prohibitive for most Palestinian farmers. Sawafta says his annual water bill is more than 100 thousand shekels (approximately $26,000) and he depends on help from international aid organizations to cover the bill. But it’s a high sum for the poor agricultural region, where the average annual per capita income is $2,000.</p>
<p>According to Sawafta, Israeli authorities have reduced the volume of water allocated to Bardala since 2000 in order to supply nearby settlements. Two wells built before 1967 to provide the village with water are fitted with meters to monitor use. A guard, he says, prevents anyone from approaching them. Deeper wells dug by Israel’s National Water Company, Mekorot, are close by.</p>
<h2>A region-wide problem?</h2>
<p>Mekorot director Ori Shani disputes the notion that Israel is the cause of water shortages faced by Palestinians. Severe drought, he says, is putting pressure not only on the West Bank, but also Israel and other neighboring countries. “Climate change has affected the volume of water and the seasons,” says Shani, “some seasons have become longer than others, causing drought in certain areas and less water in springs, a phenomenon that did not previously exist.”</p>
<p>He says visible impacts such as reduced water levels in the Sea of Galilee (Tiberias Lake) have prompted both sides to seek solutions, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been negligent in its approach to solving the crisis.</p>
<p>“The PA has not attempted to reduce water consumption by the public and has also failed to implement any projects to tackle the water shortage, such as the treatment of wastewater for cultivation purposes,” he says. “This can reduce the water shortage by 30 percent, exactly as it has done in Israel.”</p>
<p>Reduced water to villages is therefore not a problem with supply, he says, but with demand. “We supply Palestinians with double the quantity of water stipulated in agreements signed between Palestinians and Israelis,” says Shani, “the quantity of water supplied to areas inside the Green Line is much higher than that supplied to settlements.”</p>
<p>Humanitarian organizations estimate that 100,000 <em>dunums</em> of agricultural land in the Jordan Valley is affected by water shortages, forcing many farmers each year to pack up and leave. Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) head Mazen Ghneim acknowledges that climate change has played a role in reducing underground aquifers and increasing drought, but says the crisis would be greatly reduced if Israel ceased control over the valley’s water supply. According to PWA estimates, the average Palestinian in the Jordan Valley receives an average daily share of 30 liters, compared to the daily per capita share of 500 liters for an Israeli settler.</p>
<div id="attachment_389" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389" class="size-full wp-image-389" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8-3.jpg" alt="An outdated Palestinian well in Bardalah (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-389" class="wp-caption-text">An outdated Palestinian well in Bardalah (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>The way Ghneim sees it, Palestinians face few choices – either buy water back from Israel at inflated prices or attempt to renovate outdated wells. The second option is difficult and requires approval from the Israeli government, he says, which comes few and far between. But Mekorot’s Ori Shani says that it’s the Palestinian Authority government that’s been slow to begin approved renovations. “In the Joint Palestinian-Israeli Water Committee,” he says, “we Israelis agreed to renovate 60 wells in the West Bank, but the PA has not yet started the implementation of these projects.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that there is no simple solution to easing water woes in the Jordan Valley. Despite their low carbon footprint, Palestinians also have little control over emissions that climate scientists say are warming the planet and contributing to the warmer temperatures and prolonged drought, conditions that Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority head Atir says makes them doubly victimized.</p>
<p>“Emissions produced by Palestine are almost zero as Palestine does not have factories,” she says. “Israel also does not allow Palestinians to exploit underground water aquifers located within their land, which is a double blow.”</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Six months pregnant, Pushaina often thinks about the baby son she lost to an infection two years ago. She now fears for her young daughter, who often lacks clean water and receives little nourishment apart from a few swallows of <i>chicha</i>, a fermented corn drink.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Since the region’s crippling drought began three years ago, 12 children among Pushaina&#8217;s hundred extended family members have died from malnutrition, dehydration, or illnesses caused by consuming dirty, stagnant water from the earthen wells. Many mothers in this indigenous Wayúu community on the Caribbean desert peninsula of Guajira are so malnourished that they are unable to produce milk for their babies.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Long before dawn breaks, women from the <i>ranchería</i> of Porciosa set out into the night with battered plastic containers, walking for hours across the sweltering desert to retrieve clean water from the nearest potable wells. They haul it back by burro or on bicycles, or lacking those, they carry it themselves. If they can&#8217;t carry enough to meet their families&#8217; needs, they must resort to consuming water from Porciosa&#8217;s two pit wells, which are contaminated with bacteria. It&#8217;s an arduous daily ritual carried out in Wayúu rancherías, or settlements, across the state of La Guajira.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The word <i>víctima</i> in Colombia has a strong association with the country&#8217;s long-running armed conflict. But as the Colombian government moves steadily toward a peace accord, it is grappling with how to respond to a new kind of victim—people forced from their homes as they suffer the effects of higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more extreme droughts and floods.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The Wayúu&#8217;s plight underscores a broader challenge for Colombia: analyzing the climate-related tipping points that could make people already suffering poverty, conflict, or other environmental threats more likely to migrate, particularly to its crowded cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It&#8217;s an emerging concern all around the world, yet consensus on the best ways forward remains elusive. When the United Nations climate talks commence in Paris on November 30, climate-related migration is likely to garner only a small amount of space in the accord&#8217;s text. That leaves individual countries to devise their own approaches to measuring migration and displacement and safeguarding rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Worldwide an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced each year since 2008 by natural disasters related to extreme weather and climate change, according to the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nrc.no/?aid=9137092#.VkyO-SnDbJ-">Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, part of the Norwegian Refugee Council.</a></p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;We are moving beyond the social conflict already occurring in the country toward a different vulnerability, and some of those [affected] people have no recognition and no future unless we try to understand what&#8217;s happening with migration,&#8221; says Elsa Garcia Salazar, an environmental monitor specializing in climate change at the Bogotá office of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.iom.int">International Organization for Migration</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Crisis in La Guajira</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>For centuries, the Wayúu have resourcefully adapted to seasonal dry periods by migrating within their territory, which extends across the border to Venezuela. But the region&#8217;s unprecedented drought is exacerbating the effects of armed conflict, environmental degradation, and government neglect, driving many in this tribe of some 400,000 to a point of crisis.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very critical, the situation of our community,&#8221; says Arico Pushaina, a community leader in Porciosa. &#8220;If the government doesn&#8217;t help us … the Wayúu will come to an end in this land.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Scientists at <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.ideam.gov.co/">IDEAM,</a> Colombia&#8217;s institute of hydrology and meteorology, attribute Guajira&#8217;s three-year drought to repeated El Niños, a weather phenomenon causing hot and dry conditions there. But recent research says the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n2/full/nclimate2100.html">frequency of these extreme El Niño events</a> has increased due to global warming. And with <a class="ui-link" href="http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/pubs/rp/caribbean-full-eng.pdf">more intense droughts </a>predicted for this region, the fate of the people who call this windswept desert home remains uncertain.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Across Guajira Peninsula&#8217;s 9,700 square miles, a staggering 37,000 people suffer from malnutrition, according to a <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.defensoria.gov.co/public/pdf/informedefensorialguajira11.pdf">2014 report</a> by Colombia&#8217;s Ombudsman Office. Its hunger crisis intensified in August, when Venezuela closed its border and imposed strict checkpoints to fight contraband gasoline, food, and other products flowing into Colombia. Since then, the Wayúu have found it harder to get cheaper Venezuelan goods, making a bad economy even worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The drought also is exacerbating another serious water woe: the damming of the Río Ranchería, the main river that flows through La Guajira. The river was dammed in large part to quench the voracious thirst of mining companies, resulting in its flow being cut off from the Wayúu. The Wayúu are now <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.las2orillas.co/como-llego-el-caso-wayuu-la-cidh/">petitioning</a> the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to restore their access.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>No one in Porciosa has yet migrated outside of traditional Wayúu territory. But in nearby communities, some—particularly younger people—have left for other Colombian states, according to local leaders.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Garcia wants to know whether the drought is altering the Wayúu&#8217;s traditional migration patterns and pushing them in greater numbers toward urban areas and neighboring states. There&#8217;s an urgent need, she says, for rigorous data collection tools that can aid policymakers in understanding how phenomena linked to climate change are contributing to human migration—not only in La Guajira but throughout the country.</p>

<p><a class="ui-link" href="http://www.cgdev.org/page/mapping-impacts-climate-change">One study</a> ranks Colombia 18th in the world for climate change risks—two to three times the risk of neighboring Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador: From expansive agricultural lands to urban centers in the Andes to nearly 2,000 miles of coastline, the majority of Colombians live in places likely to be affected by extreme weather, sea level rise, and other phenomena exacerbated by global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of challenges with climate change issues,&#8221; says Rodrigo Suárez Castaño, director of the climate change division at Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. &#8220;If things keep going this way, we&#8217;re going to have more people moving and more people living in cities. It&#8217;s a big question and challenge we have on our hands.&#8221;</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Colombia&#8217;s Wake-up Call</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Last year, Colombia became one of the first countries in South America to include migration in its <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.minambiente.gov.co/index.php/component/content/article/476-plantilla-cambio-climatico-32">national climate change adaptation plan</a>.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>A pivotal event for the Colombian government in recognizing the potential for climate-induced migration was the devastating, widespread La Niña floods in 2010 and 2011, which affected more than three million people throughout the country. There is no clear data on how many people were ultimately displaced, but flooding and mudslides damaged nearly 500,000 homes and affected millions of acres of agricultural lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It was a wake-up call. Following the floods, the government collaborated with the International Organization for Migration to track 2,000 people who had been displaced—an initial step toward a national climate migration study. The survey revealed trends similar to those seen in conflict displacement. Two years after the floods, nearly half had not yet returned home. Many had migrated to large cities like Medellín, Bogotá, and Cartagena.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Like those displaced by conflict, people displaced by the flooding lost property, income, and social support networks. They often settled informally on the fringe of cities in undesirable areas lacking basic infrastructure. People arriving from rural agricultural regions also tended to lack skills necessary to find jobs in an urban economy.</p>
<div id="attachment_322" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC_0662.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-image-322 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg" alt="DSC_0662" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-caption-text">Wayuu women return to Porciosa after filling plastic containers with dirty water from the village&#8217;s two artisanal wells.  (Credit: Autumn Spanne)</p></div>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The small study underscored that cities need to be prepared to receive new migrants as part of their own climate adaptation plans. So far, they lack systems for preparing for them.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Can the Cities Cope?</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Take the Colombian city of Cartagena. The city is home to tens of thousands of displaced conflict victims, many of whom settle informally along the major coastal lagoon of Cienaga de la Virgen with no sewer, water, or other municipal services. The arrival of more people because of climate-related phenomena—like flooding to the city&#8217;s south, rising seas that threaten the islands off its coast, and drought in La Guajira—will add to the pressures.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>But while Cartagena has one of the most advanced adaptation plans in the region, the city hasn&#8217;t yet developed a strategy for climate migration. Suárez says the national government is supporting such efforts by providing guidelines.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t make a commitment to getting solid data about patterns of climate migration, we will not have adequate tools for decision-making,&#8221; says Dolly González, Cartagena&#8217;s city planning director. &#8220;People who arrive in Cartagena because of climate change are staying outside of the government aid programs, because the focus has been conflict.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Beyond counting and tracking migrants, governments face challenges in developing legal mechanisms to provide ongoing support after initial crises like floods and fires. In Colombia, those fleeing extreme weather aren&#8217;t covered by the same laws that protect the rights of conflict-displaced migrants. So far, there isn&#8217;t even a standardized international definition of what constitutes a climate migrant.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The big question now is whether migration and displacement will be included in a new UN climate accord. Ahead of Paris, some developing nations proposed a new entity to organize humanitarian responses to climate-related disasters.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>There&#8217;s general agreement that climate migration will grow in coming decades, notes Walter Kaelin of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.nanseninitiative.org">Nansen Initiative</a>, which is working to improve international responses to people displaced by natural disasters. But providing compensation for affected countries is a sticking point. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have something in the Paris outcome, it will be much more difficult to keep this on the list of priorities,&#8221; he says.</p>

<h2><b>A Plea to Preserve a Culture</b></h2>

<p>Back in Porciosa, Virginia Pushaina watches her 19-month-old daughter grow weak and cry for food. She notices that the toddler has the same skin rash that her son developed before contracting a fatal infection. But she doesn&#8217;t have much time to dwell on such unsettling thoughts. Each day she must give herself completely to the present: tending her daughter, walking miles to fetch water, and making <i>mochilas</i>, intricately-woven cotton bags popular with tourists that have become crucial to the economic survival of many Wayúu families.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is early Thursday evening in mid-September; the sun is setting into a veil of smog from the power plants and people are coming back from work. This could be any small industrial town in Russia, but it is Norilsk — a northern city of 180 thousand people with an average annual temperature of minus 9.8 degrees Celsius. There is a one in three chance the palladium in your mobile phone was mined here. Norilsk is also officially the most polluted city in Russia and one of the most polluted in the world.</p>
<p>I was born in the capital of the Krasnoyarsk region, of which Norilsk is the second largest city. This is my first time so far north, some 1,500 kilometers away from where my family still lives. During a walk around town, I found myself standing in front of an apartment building whose aboveground foundations are big enough to walk into. It may sound strange to most, but this style of building has been adapted for the presence of permafrost.</p>
<p>In Norilsk and other northern cities, buildings are “lifted” above ground to ensure an air gap limits the amount of thermal impact on the frozen ground. Otherwise warm water and heat from the building can melt the permafrost cover, decreasing its bearing capacity or how much weight the foundation can hold. Often permafrost melts unevenly, which leads to cracks in larger, more complex structures and even partial collapses.</p>
<div id="attachment_84" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-image-84" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min-683x1024.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost" width="429" height="643" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-caption-text">Peering into the lifted foundation of a building in Norilsk (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see what the foundation looks like — through the gaping hole in the side of the housing structure. While this hole is there to prevent the melting permafrost, it may be adding to it. Some thermal impact is unavoidable, but it’s clear that these permafrost-reinforced buildings are not getting the maintenance they need. And yet, no one returning home from a long day of work appears to be worried that this hole is there.</p>
<h2>Uncommon ground</h2>
<p>Explorers of the Russian East during the 17<sup>th</sup> century had a difficult time convincing the capital that they really had found soil that stayed frozen year round, even in the summer when only a thin top layer would melt. We now know that permafrost actually covers two-thirds of Russia’s territory —more than the total area of Canada.</p>
<p>This frozen land is home to more than a third of the country’s proved reserves of oil and gas and over 90% of estimated reserves, some of the largest gold, tin, nickel, copper and coal deposits, as well as freshwater and forest resources. Large-scale industrial exploration of the region, which started in the 20th century, required building power plants, factories and housing that could withstand the frozen ground and extreme conditions of the North. A growing need to better understand the science behind permafrost sparked robust research efforts in the Soviet Union during this time.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, the country had а specialized permafrost research institution, with a vast network of monitoring stations in western and eastern Siberia. Experimental sites were also set up to study permafrost under various stresses and conditions. The USSR held the world’s second international conference on the subject in July 1973, in the East Siberian city of Yakutsk, where attendees could see &#8220;six-story apartment buildings being constructed” as well as the 117 meter “well”, or Shergin shaft, used for the first scientific study of permafrost a century earlier.</p>
<div id="attachment_62" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/pic-12-187x337.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-62" class="wp-image-62 " src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/pic-12-187x337.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost 1" width="215" height="387" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-12-187x337.jpg 187w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-12-187x337-166x300.jpg 166w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-62" class="wp-caption-text">Underground rainbow (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>A history museum in the central Siberian town of Igarka tells the story of early settlers who started building a lumber mill in the summer of 1929. The town later rose to prominence as a regional hub for the international lumber trade, but the early houses and structures they constructed barely survived the winter as people were not prepared to deal with complications stemming from building on the frozen surface. Igarka’s permafrost research station was founded later that year.</p>
<h2>New times</h2>
<p>Today, the people and industry that drove migration to the inhospitable region are still there. The Russian Arctic is home to some 2 million people who produce around 4% of the country’s GDP and 20% of its exports. Another 5 million live in the so-called sub-Arctic regions. Most of these estimates can vary quite significantly across sources, in part because legal boundaries of what is now officially called the Russian Arctic zone were not defined until the spring of 2014.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the global Arctic, Russia’s Far North is already a highly urbanized region with over 80% of the population living in settlements of 5,000 people or greater. Approximately 40 towns in the area have populations of over 10,000 people; at least five – Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Noyabrsk, Novy Urengoy and Norilsk – have more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>But most of these settlements are getting smaller, mainly due to economic migration. Murmansk, the world’s largest city north of the Arctic Circle, and Norilsk have lost about a third of their populations since 1990. For smaller settlements such as Igarka or Tiksi on the Arctic coast of Yakutia, the figure is closer to 60 or 70%. Overall, the region is estimated to have lost a quarter to a third of its population in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>Shrinking populations and general socioeconomic stagnation in towns that are no longer connected to oil and gas, or mining industries are partly to blame for the neglect visible in older buildings, not unlike the one I walked into in Norilsk. Local municipalities responsible for this upkeep receive little to no support from the higher levels of government and often have no means of adequately funding the continuous maintenance required for Soviet-era infrastructure.</p>
<div id="attachment_83" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83" class="wp-image-83 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min-1024x685.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost" width="760" height="508" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-83" class="wp-caption-text">Poor housing maintenance is no laughing matter (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>Over the last few decades, interest in permafrost has also plummeted. Russian papers on the subject and a 2014 state report on climate change give an overview of the extent of damage to buildings in Igarka, Tiksi and other smaller settlements on permafrost in the Siberian North and further to the east. Numbers range from place to place, between 40 or 50 percent of all structures with deformations in some cities and even 100 percent in unnamed remote settlements in the Siberian Arctic. This review relies mainly on a non-peer-reviewed source from 2001.</p>
<p>Dr. Oleg Anisimov of the State Hydrological Institute in Saint Petersburg, who was one of the lead authors of the 2014 report, agrees the data is old but says there is simply no newer information because hardly anyone is studying this issue now. &#8220;Permafrost itself is a really simple thing, actually, all processes there are incredibly well understood. The difficulty lies in the fact that there’s very little data on its current state and trends”, he adds.</p>
<p>A lot of Russian research on permafrost conditions such as temperature or active layer thickness – how deep it melts in the short summers – ceased in the 1990s when political and economic turmoil left research stations severely underfunded and understaffed. Data from Roshydromet, the state weather and climate service, suggests that in 2014, only 36 out of 64 Russian stations involved in the global Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project actually collected data, and most had continual measurements for no longer than 10 to 15 years. This lack of data complicates any estimate of long-term trends, says Dr. Anisimov.</p>
<p>“Only 12 to 15 of these stations in Russia have long time series, and they are used in the analysis. And now try and picture those 12 to 15 stations, most of which are located along the Arctic coast, against the whole area of Russian permafrost,” Anisimov, who is also involved in gathering and processing this data, notes. Overall, the CALM network has 168 stations in 15 countries; Canada, where permafrost covers about half the landmass, has some 60 stations with measurements dating back to the start of the project in 1991.</p>
<p>Symbolically, a decades-old map documenting permafrost cover adorns the wall of the director’s office in the Igarka research station. Dated 1991, it’s a comprehensive picture of permafrost conditions across Siberia and elsewhere, but it’s also a map of a different country – the Soviet Union. Dr. Nikita Tananaev, former head of the research station and a research scientist with the Melnikov Permafrost Insitute in Yakutsk, says newer maps of permafrost conditions do exist, but they cover smaller areas and much of the information gathered, for instance, by oil and gas companies is proprietary. “To make a new map at this scale — this one is quite detailed — we would have to collect lots and lots of new data. And there is no one to make everyone share the information they do have.” he says.</p>
<h2>A cold topic</h2>
<p>According to WWF Russia’s Dr. Alexey Kokorin, who works to develop climate change awareness in these regions, there is little interest in sharing this information and building a more accurate picture of the state of permafrost. Oil and gas companies who have invested in this research have already built their infrastructure to be &#8220;almost immune to changes in permafrost.” Government estimates, however, indicate that it may still cost them up to 55 billion rubles (a little over $800 million) a year in maintenance. And since a decrease in population is naturally followed by a decrease in demand for housing, the plight of the people remaining in these crumbling Arctic settlements “is not really sounding the alarms”, says Kokorin.</p>
<p>There’s also a surprising complacency from those left to deal with “building deformities&#8221; on a daily basis. A section of apartments in a residential building in Igarka had to be abandoned after damage to the foundation had rendered them unsafe — but residents still live in other parts of that complex. Two houses down that street, an entire half of another building had to be demolished. It seems like much of this acceptance of present conditions stems from a peculiar fatalism common to all Russians but particularly striking in the North. When I asked a woman who had lived in that apartment building for 10 years if she was scared to stay there, she expressed a sentiment I would continue to hear throughout my trip: of course I am, but what is there to do?</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/pic-06-223x337.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" class="wp-image-63 " src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/pic-06-223x337.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost 3" width="255" height="385" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-06-223x337.jpg 223w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-06-223x337-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-63" class="wp-caption-text">Building degrading from permafrost (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>During my travels, I passed a shiny new youth activity center in Dudinka, a major river port town the Siberian Arctic. The building had a memorable poem written on its side: “If we have to, then we have to, then our gardens here will bloom.” It’s a quote from a Soviet song called “70th Parallel Kids.” Sitting at the 69<sup>th</sup> parallel, Dudinka is close, but it’s so cold you can barely grow onions here.</p>
<p>Residents of the North are quite aware of the changing climate realities they face, but the issue of thawing permafrost has taken a backseat to other concerns. In casual conversations about the weather, people often lament that traditional predictions of weather patterns based on years of observation no longer hold. The Yenisey, Lena and other Siberian rivers are also experiencing marked shifts in their fall freeze and spring melt times. In the Taymyr peninsula, the northernmost part of central Siberia, both indigenous communities and scientists have confirmed that deer have already started wintering in places they used to leave because of the extreme cold. While locals are worried about the future impacts of climate change on infrastructure, these problems are nothing new. Many residents have lived in these crumbling buildings for decades.</p>
<p>Despite a lack of perceived urgency, the threat posed by thawing permafrost to these settlements is real. The IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report states that, with a high level of confidence, &#8220;rising temperatures, leading to the further thawing of permafrost, and changing precipitation patterns have the potential to affect infrastructure and related services in the Arctic,” with particular concerns for damage to residential buildings and storage facilities for hazardous materials.</p>
<p>Russia’s own second assessment report on climate change and its consequences paints a more detailed picture. It asserts that climate change has already led to &#8220;a decrease in the permafrost bearing capacity by 17% on average and by up to 45% in some regions relative to the 1970s.” This means that in some parts of western Siberia, permafrost degradation is already approaching the limits of operational safety. According to the same research, degradation is less severe in the central Asian part of the Arctic, northern Yakutia and the Krasnoyarsk territory.</p>
<div id="attachment_82" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-82" class="wp-image-82 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min-1024x542.jpg" alt="A Soviet-era sign urging people to keep their houses safe and avoid permafrost degradation by keeping water and trash out of the basement (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)" width="760" height="402" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-82" class="wp-caption-text">A Soviet-era sign urging people to keep their houses safe and avoid permafrost degradation by keeping water and trash out of the basement (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>While Dr. Anisimov agrees that climate change is contributing to the thawing permafrost, he says there are more urgent problems to address. &#8220;A building itself really does not care why a decrease in the permafrost bearing capacity happened — it just happened. Right now the dominant factor for us is bad maintenance, and attributing this to climate [change] would be silly. It does not diminish the issue, though, it just means one problem is compounded by the other”, says Anisimov. “You cannot separate them: construction standards have to be reviewed and updated to reflect changing climate norms.”</p>
<h2>Limits of risk</h2>
<p>In theory, any new construction in the north should be planned with climate change in mind, but Anisimov says he has yet to come across a project whose developers are accounting for this risk. “There is this very clear idea among engineers that climate change is completely made up and a hoax. Yes, sometimes it’s warmer — but there are always fluctuations and that is why safety factors exist,” he says. “Climate science is in one corner and engineering is in another.”</p>
<p>This reluctance to bring climate change into the engineering equation may seem somewhat understandable. The second national assessment report claims that improper management and maintenance are having a far more damaging affect on infrastructure built on permafrost than climate change. In fact, one of the major changes between this report and its predecessor from 2008 is a more conservative approach to the link between climate change and infrastructure risks and a more nuanced representation of the problem.</p>
<p>Climate change may not yet trump poor maintenance, but that does not mean it can be discounted. “Since the ultimate reason behind most failures and accidents is a decrease in bearing capacity, which is projected to continue throughout this century, the current problems with infrastructure &lt;…&gt; can be viewed as a physical model of what can happen due to climate change in the absence of other impacts”, the report continues.</p>
<div id="attachment_80" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-80" class="wp-image-80 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min-1024x642.jpg" alt="Dudinka, a city of contrasts in housing maintenance (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)" width="760" height="476" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min-1024x642.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-80" class="wp-caption-text">Dudinka, a city of contrasts in housing maintenance (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>In other words, just as with extreme weather events, even though climate change may only be partly responsible for what we are seeing now, it is a very useful snapshot into what can happen in the future, even with proper construction and maintenance. It may well become the straw that breaks the camel’s back or, in this case, the foundation pile.</p>
<p>Anisimov also notes that the common safety factor Russians use for bearing capacity, whether or not permafrost is involved, is around 40%. This number means that a Russian foundation pile can potentially hold 40% more weight than it will actually have to once a building has been constructed — it’s a margin left for safety purposes. In other countries like the U.S. or Canada it’s closer to 90%, so “this means an eventual decline in bearing capacity due to rising temperatures in the permafrost will approach the safety limits much sooner here [in Russia] than in other places,” he says.</p>
<h2>Left out in the cold</h2>
<p>Permafrost degradation and the resulting risks to infrastructure used to fall under the responsibility of the Ministry of Regional Development. In a report submitted to the UN in 2013, Russia announced that its ministry was “leading the development of a science–based set of measures to minimize risks to buildings, transport and infrastructure from the southern permafrost border shifting to the north.”</p>
<p>According to court documents and information from the federal procurement system, the ministry did contract work on this initiative out to a Moscow construction research institute in August 2012. But then in September 2014 this ministry was dissolved, and experts say it is not immediately clear which agencies, if any, took over its climate change portfolio. A representative of the Gersevanov Research Institute of Bases and Underground Structures confirmed that it completed a $270,000 study for the government, but is still waiting to be paid. Its research has not been released to the public.</p>
<div id="attachment_81" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81" class="wp-image-81 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min-1024x663.jpg" alt="Some maintenance being done in Norilsk may be too little, too late (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)" width="760" height="492" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-81" class="wp-caption-text">Some maintenance being done in Norilsk may be too little, too late (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>At the 2014 UN climate conference in Lima, countries from Chile to Finland met to discuss the impacts of climate change on glaciers, ice caps and the Polar Regions. Russia has the largest amount of permafrost in the world, yet its delegation was noticeably absent. That was a public outreach event with no direct impact on the negotiations but it was still striking to see the same indifference found everywhere from official strategies to city streets.</p>
<p>Climate change may continue to trail engineering issues in its impact on Arctic buildings, or it may eventually force us to reinvent construction on permafrost altogether. A new building in the early stages of construction that I found in Norilsk may one day crack due to simple neglect — or it may do so because of failure to account for climate change risks in the project. The need for accurate and relevant information on the state of permafrost in a changing climate has never been more pressing. Whether or not Russia is willing to study or discuss this problem, extensive infrastructure damage in the North as well as the worries of those who live there are unlikely to melt away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is taking a heavy economic toll on Canada&#8217;s far north, with buildings collapsing as melting permafrost destroys foundations, rivers running low and wildfires all a drain on the region&#8217;s limited finances, senior government officials said.</p>
<p>A sprawling area spanning the Arctic Circle with a population of less than 50,000, Canada&#8217;s Northwest Territories has spent more than $140 million in the last two years responding to problems linked to global warming, the territory&#8217;s finance minister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our budgets are getting squeezed dramatically from climate change,&#8221; Finance and Environment Minister J. Michael Miltenberger said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The roads are constantly moving as the permafrost is melting&#8230; massive shore erosion is putting buildings at risk. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few years and the tie to climate change is more and more evident.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this windswept territory, which already relies on central government subsidies, responding to global warming is crucial for its financial survival.</p>
<p>A major U.N. conference in Paris in December will aim to create a new global deal to curb climate change to take effect from 2020.</p>
<p>Scientists want to keep international temperature rises below 2 degrees compared with pre-industrial levels, while providing poor countries with money for adaptation.</p>
<p>But in parts of the Northwest Territories, average temperatures have already risen more than three degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, government officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Paris, we are hoping for whatever it takes to turn this (climate change) around,&#8221; politician Bob Bromley said in the territorial capital, Yellowknife.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to require all hands on deck, and willing hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>DIESEL DEPENDENCE</p>
<p>The delicate ecosystem of the wide-skied territory, home to the indigenous Dene people, and where wolves, caribou and bison roam, has been plunged into a environmental vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Climate change has been linked to decreased water levels in the territory&#8217;s major rivers, partly due to greater evaporation, causing a sharp contraction in hydro electric power generation.</p>

<p>As a result, the government has had to import more diesel, borrowing about $30 million this year alone to make up for the electricity shortfall, hurting its budget and increasing climate-warming emissions in a catastrophic feedback loop.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not sustainable,&#8221; said Miltenberger, the finance and environment minister.</p>
<p>He called on Canada&#8217;s national government to provide more financial help for climate change mitigation, particularly in renewable power, to reduce the costs of importing diesel.</p>
<p>With a small population, and high operating costs due to its size and climate, the territory&#8217;s main employers are diamond mining and the public sector. The region&#8217;s indigenous people rely on the hunting of caribou as a key food source, but herds are declining, with climate change likely a significant driver.</p>
<p>Northwest Territories <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/mtp-eng.asp"><strong>receives</strong></a> financial transfer payments of about $1.3 billion, or about $29,000 per resident, from Canada&#8217;s national government to run public services.</p>
<p>Craig Scott, executive director of Ecology North, a Yellowknife-based environmental group, believes the government should have invested earlier in renewable energy.</p>
<p>Fuel trucks hauling diesel along gravel roads to small rural communities are a common site across the territory.</p>
<p>Generators have been working around the clock following the decline in hydro power, Scott said, and new holding tanks had to be imported to store the diesel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Renewable energies (including) micro hydro, solar and biomass have high capital costs in the short-term,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;But they are sustainable versus the long-term pain of diesel.&#8221;</p>
