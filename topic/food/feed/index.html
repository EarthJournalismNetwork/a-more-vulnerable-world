	<p>As they take off into the wild, surrounded by resin trees, the morning light illuminates four wanderers in their jungle sanctuary. “We call this place our home. This is where we feel protected,” they explain.</p>
<p>Hein Yeun, Loun Keuth and his dad Loun Hon, and their friend Srey Tey (see photo from left to right) belong to the Kuy indigenous community. One of the largest ethnic groups in Cambodia, the Kuy live in harmony with the forest, living mostly off what Prey Lang has to offer.</p>
<div class="map">
<p>A relocation site for the Kuy minority during the Khmer Rouge period, the village of Phneak Rolerk is now home to over 100 families.</p>
<p>Located at the edge of the forest, it is one of the most remote places in Cambodia. Access is limited to one road, making it hard to get food and goods from the city. For the past two generations, the community has been living sustainably by relying on the forest and surrounding land to  survive.</p>
<p>Prey Lang provides an abundant source of resources and blesses the Kuy community with farmland, food, medicine, rattan, vines, and other natural gifts that the villagers can use and rely on.</p>
<p>In Phneak Rolerk, life follows the organic rhythm of nature, rooted in the essence of community life: harmony with the environment.</p>
<h2><b>Tapping resin</b></h2>
<p>Every week, Hon, Keuth,Yeun, Tey, and other members of their community enter the forest to tap the remaining resin trees.</p>
<p>“We have a deep connection with Prey Lang because we look for its natural products. The forest is like our nurturing mother,” Hon explains. </p>
<p>A 50-year old farmer, Hon learned how to collect resin from his parents. He now is passing the trade on to his 23-year-old son, Keuth. Proud of his Kuy roots and traditions, Keuth explains how they collect the precious extract.</p>
<p>“During the rainy season, it takes about a week to collect the resin from the tree. You have to come twice to the same tree. First, you notch the bark, burn the fluid and cover it with leaves. Then, a week later, you burn it back and collect it with a bucket,” he says.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Hon and his fellow tappers have been able to harvest at least a barrel of resin a day, but this year they collected only half of that amount. Its value has also plummeted. In 2014, it was estimated at about $10.25 per 30 liters. In 2015, the villagers were receiving only half of that price. In Cambodia, resin tappers sell their product to traders and transporters, for domestic and foreign retailers.</p>
<p>Resin is a multipurpose material that has a variety of uses in the Mekong region, from sealing boats to varnishing homes. Its annual global value in Cambodia is <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp28e.pdf" target="_blank">estimated at $6 million</a>. </p>
<p>“Resin is the main source of income for the community,” Hon explains. ”Losing the forest is like losing our living,” he says.</p>
<h2>A spirit mandate</h2>
<p>A community strongly tied to their animist beliefs, the Kuy people say that the Neaktah—or ancestral spirits— have blessed their presence in the forest. The Neaktah watch over people and places as long as they are paid respect through prayers and offerings.</p>
<p>Every year, the villagers gather to ask Neaktah for fertile land and seed their hopes for abundant harvests for the year to come. “We change every year and come back to the original land every three or four years,” Hon explains.</p>

<section id="chapter-438374" class="chapter atavist-section chapter-type-0 web chapter-438374 chapter-type-text ">
<p>Saom Than, a 48-year-old farmer explains that the Neaktah are protective spirits that watch over the community. “Each village has their own, and the land belongs to them,” he says.</p>
<p>According to Kuy beliefs, the Neaktah ensure safety to the people by warding off imminent threats. “Neaktah always provide for the people. We can find fruits when we are hungry and we do not have to worry from wild animals. But now that the forest is gone, I do not feel like I am protected anymore,” Saom Than confides.</p>
<p>As Prey Lang’s trees vanish from the activities of illegal loggers, so too, the Kuy believe, do the Neaktah spirits. “If the forest dies, we die”—say many in the community, fearful that disappearing spirits will leave the Kuy people vulnerable and unprotected.</p>

	<p>"What are we going to do?”</p>
<p>Wandering in the midst of down-turned yellow rice stems, Hon is worried about this year’s harvest. “Before, we had regular rain and our crops were better,” he says, showing dead corn. “Look at it now.”</p>
<p>The Kuy community has long been self-sufficient, mainly relying on harvesting rice and using products from the forest. But yields have declined over the past eight years and the community has observed changes in rainfall.</p>
<p>“Since 2007, it has become hotter and storms prevent us from going to the jungle and our farmland,” Srey Tey says, his voice heavy with regret. “I have been living here all my life. The trees do not produce as many fruits anymore. Usually, if there is enough humidity, they grow. But this is no more the case.” Tey says this has also contributed to the decline in resin earnings.</p>
<p>Nodding, Hon emphasizes the significance of regular rain. “In this village, the daily life of the community moves in time with the water. When there is rain, there is work,” he says.</p>
<p>As the sun rises over rows of rice fields, paddy workers are already feeling the immense heat. “It is supposed to be the beginning of the harvesting season, but we do not really know when this is anymore,” Hon says with a lump in his throat. “It has become random.”</p>

	<h2>The vicious cycle of deforestation</h2>
<p>For the Kuy people, walking in the forest under such heat feels as oppressive as seeing it vanish. “Before, there were more trees and the rain was regular. If this year stays dry, we will collect less resin,” Hon says. “This is because of illegal logging.”</p>
<p>The loss of forest cover is likely having a major impact on local rain cycles and scientists estimate that deforestation is responsible for up to one-sixth of global carbon emissions, which contribute to warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>In addition to sheltering the Kuy people, Prey Lang also provides crucial habitat for endangered flora and fauna species, some of which are only found in Cambodia. But as the weather keeps changing, these species continue to disappear.</p>
<p>Traditional medicine collectors in the forest villages have observed the extinction of specific plants that had been used to treat various ailments. “The elder of the village tells me that it is very difficult to find effective plants nowadays,” Saom Than claims. “I sometimes still go to the forest to find medicine, but I never find everything I want,” he says.</p>

	<p>In the Kuy dialect, Prey Lang means “our forest.” The community calls it home and has been living here for at least two generations. Spanning four provinces and covering 3,600 square kilometers, Prey Land is considered to be the largest evergreen forest in the country and likely the most expansive in Indochina.</p>
<div id="attachment_689" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-689" class="wp-image-689 " src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-1024x723.jpg" alt="Prey-Lang Map" width="633" height="447" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-1024x723.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-300x212.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-1020x720.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /><p id="caption-attachment-689" class="wp-caption-text">Land use patterns near Prey Lang.

<h2>A vanishing place</h2>
<p>While Prey Lang is a source of life for the community, it is a constant source of worries too. Speaking in her home where villagers gather before heading out on patrols, Hon’s sister sees troubled times ahead. “As a minority, even if we can mark our land, we have no land title,” she says. This means they can be evicted at any time.</p>
<p>Local activist Phouk Hong, a 40-year-old mother of five, agrees and says the community’s claim to their beloved forest is under threat.</p>
<p>“Prey Lang was full of precious wood. This led companies to come here and cut the precious trees. There is almost none of them left and this has a great impact on the biodiversity and our livelihood,” she says.</p>
<p>One of her neighbors, Un Vien, is angry at the local authorities for what he says are injustices committed against the Kuy people. “The forest keeps vanishing since 1997,” he says. “When we carry small piece of wood to our houses, we can be arrested. But when whole trucks full of precious wood were going to Phnom Penh or Koh Kong to be shipped away, none of them are arrested. How come the local police cannot see this?” he angrily asks pointing at a felled tree log.</p>
<p>And as his voice slowly disappears between the leaves, Vien rushes trough a narrow path only to discover more felled trees. But this, he says, only strengthens his commitment to saving the forest.</p>
<h2>Feeding over a million people</h2>
<p>The loss of the Prey Lang forest <a class="regular-link" href="http://preylang.net/download/reports/Monitor-Report2_April-July-2015_english_final-version_reduced-file-size.pdf" target="_blank">would affect at least 1.5 million people in the Mekong region</a>. Over time, the future of the forest could play an important role in the fate of the larger Mekong region.</p>
<p>“Prey Lang has valuable ecological importance [and its] ecosystem plays critical roles in [the] water regulation between the Tonle Sap and Mekong Basins,” a representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Phnom Penh explains. The Tonle Sap is one of the world’s most productive freshwater ecosystems. So productive that it has earned the lake the nickname “Cambodia’s beating heart.”</p>
</p>
<p>The Kuy community is well aware of the situation. Hong, for example, has become a dedicated activist that is committed to protecting the remaining forest for her, her family, and her community, but also all the people she knows are benefiting from Prey Lang.</p>
<p>“You start to realize what is going on when your livelihood is threatened. My family and I lived off the resin trees; now that they are less, we need to organize ourselves to protect them,” she says, fully aware of the change it will bring to her family’s life. “I have to go to the capital often to coordinate our actions with other activists. Sometimes, I wish I could just stay in the farm and take care of what I have here,” she admits.</p>
<p>But Hong says the fight is larger than her life. The threats to Prey Lang put the future of her family and the community in danger of losing their main source of income and their traditional way of life. For the Kuy people, protecting the forest has become a matter of survival.</p>

	<p>In the dark of night, the glow of a fire leaves a faint light on faces weary from days of walking in the jungle. The group of ten lies awake in their makeshift camp, hoping for a strong breeze to fan their dying fire.</p>
<p>Voices carry from the distance, broken occasionally by the persistent sound of chainsaws. Loggers are working under the cover of darkness. Tonight, they will cut enough trees until their truck is loaded or they stop to catch a few hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Back at the camp, the Kuy patrol is conflicted. Some want to leave the camp now and catch the loggers in the act, but to do so could be dangerous.</p>
<p>“Safety comes first. At night, we cannot access nor see anything. We don’t know if the loggers possess any weapon or gun, and we are not enough to patrol,” Hong explains. “We should wait until the morning,” she concludes.</p>
<p>But the night will be short for most of the patrollers. No one can sleep listening to the loggers carry out their work.</p>
<p>The Kuy people feel at home in this forest. In better times, the fires were a place to tell stories from the past, and communicate regrets and hopes. This is where experiences are shared, questions asked and spirits built.</p>
<p>Tonight, the patrol lies still in the darkness, hoping that the sun will soon rise to shed light on the strangers attempting to steal Prey Lang’s trees.</p>
<h2>Hostile surroundings</h2>
<p>It is still dark when the patrol rises and begins to pack up camp. Hong’s eyes sparkle as she explains their strategy. “We will leave now and walk until we reach the loggers’ area. At that point, we will split in teams to surround them, guided by the sound of their chainsaws. When the signal is given, we will all [rush in].”</p>
<p>Her voice is as soft and quiet as her footsteps, but the chainsaws are louder than ever before. Suddenly the patrol breaks out into a full run.</p>
<p>All of the loggers’ equipment is quickly seized. “We confiscate knives, axes and chainsaws. Everything that they can use against us and allow then to react violently,” Hong explains, struggling to catch her breath.</p>
<p>The patrollers then take the names of the two loggers and have them sign an agreement with their thumbprints never to come back to log in Prey  Lang.</p>
<p>Although the Prey Lang Community Network has taken it upon themselves to defend the forest, they do not have any authority to arrest the loggers or store the wood and chainsaws. But they carefully retain these signed documents, hoping it will make a difference. “When wood is confiscated, we inform the local pagoda about it and everything is delivered there. We have had very bad experience with the local authorities in the past. They never collaborate with us to protect the forest, even if it is their duty. When we trust them and gave them what we confiscated, they generally gave all equipment back to the loggers. The community is doing the government’s job,” Hong explains.</p>
<p>Instead the patrol now uses acid to destroy the internal mechanism of the chainsaws. Sand is sometimes also used. One by one, they also cut the wooden planks they find on site.</p>
<h2>Patrolling the forest</h2>
<div id="attachment_672" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/024_RAA_6647.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-672" class="wp-image-672 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-1024x683.jpg" alt="024_RAA_6647" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-1020x681.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-672" class="wp-caption-text">Ma Lom, Teon Roeun, Sean Khoeun and Vong Sophy, members of the Prey Lang Community Network, during a patrol in Prey Lang forest. © Antoine Raab / Ruom</p></div>
<p>Every other month, about 20 network members will embark on similar journeys through the forest to catch illegal loggers. The bigger the group, the less likely they will be confronted with violence. “We all do this together,” Hong says.</p>
<p>More than a patrol, the journey through the forest is an ancestral Kuy practice. Like nomadic herders, they choose a new home every night and believe they are protected by the spirits of the forest. Although these journeys now carry a much more somber purpose, the Kuy share laughter and stories that remind them of the sovereignty of the surrounding  trees.</p>
<div class="swiper-container swiper-container-horizontal">
<h2>Advocacy on the Internet</h2>
<p>Deep in the forest, modernity is catching up quickly for the better.</p>
<p>Hong’s nephew Keuth is 23 years-old. He has been actively involved in the protection of Prey Lang since he was a child. “My father first joined the Network and I did like him.” he says proudly. “I belong to the Prey Lang Youth and I have gathered my friends in the village to join in protecting the forest.”</p>
<p>Keuth joined his dad on his first forest patrol a decade ago. “At first, I was scared,” he admits, “but now I am not afraid anymore.”</p>
<p>Keuth now takes part in every patrol and never leave his smartphone at home.</p>
<div id="attachment_692" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/053_RAA_8509.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692" class="size-large wp-image-692" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-1024x683.jpg" alt="Loun Keuth, 23, farmer and activist, records and documents every patrol he takes part in with his smartphone, using the Prey Lang App. © Antoine Raab / Ruom" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-1020x681.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-692" class="wp-caption-text">Loun Keuth, 23, farmer and activist, records and documents every patrol he takes part in with his smartphone, using the Prey Lang App. © Antoine Raab / Ruom</p></div>
<p>Keuth is a new generation of forest activist who sees value in using social media to raise awareness. “Posting on Facebook is really helpful because we can publish proof of illegal logging,” he says. “We want to let countries see what is happening to our forest and we would like them to help us protect it.”</p>
</div>
<p>Through social networks, the Prey Lang Community Network has been publishing regular reports to summarize the data collected. “I believe that if people see what is going on with their own eyes, they will take an interest. This is not only addressed to foreigners, I also want to let other Cambodians know how much of the Prey Lang forest is still standing,” Keuth explains. Up until September, the Network recorded at least 2,000 forest crimes in Prey Lang, from corruption to license abuses. </p>
<section id="chapter-625098" class="chapter atavist-section chapter-type-0 web chapter-625098 chapter-type-text ">
<p>"What the Network is doing deters small loggers,” Fran Lambrick, an ethnobiologist and film maker who has been studying the Prey Lang forest in the past 5 years, says. “But the bigger fish—the ones logging illegally for large companies—are organized differently. They have moving sawmills for example, and they also treat the forest as it is their own property,” she explains, commending the courage of the communities fighting back.</p>
<p>But danger to the forest and its dwellers looms large. In recent months, there’s been an uptick in environmental activists being killed and arrested. Both Tey and Hong have received threats from local authorities. The death of Chut Wutty, a prominent environmental activist who was killed in 2012, stills weighs heavily on the community.</p>
<p>“If we do not take care of the forest, who will?” Hong asks. But the loggers are a persistent threat. A company was recently granted a license to log parts of the forest is a known foe. “We already kicked them out in 2000 when we submitted a petition to our King Sihanouk,” Vien explains. But King Sihanouk passed away in 2012 and this time, the concession will be legal. There’s a long road ahead, but the Kuy activists intend to keep defending their forest on their own, one log at a time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A boy named Nguyen Van Trong walked cautiously along a ditch while keeping his eyes trained on the ground. Every day he returns to this mangrove forest to search for discarded plastic bottles that he can sell. On a good day, he can make up to two dollars, which helps to supplement his family’s income. They are among the many in Cha Va village who are losing their farmland because of sea level rise.</p>
<div id="attachment_120" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151104112333-img-3405.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120" class="size-full wp-image-120" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151104112333-img-3405.jpg" alt="A boy collects plastic bottles to sell for money to help his family in Cha Va village, Lam Hai commune, Nam Can district, Ca Mau province.

<h2>Tarnished gold</h2>
<p>Ca Mau is Vietnam’s southernmost province and an important part of the country’s agricultural economy. The Mekong Delta region produces much of the country’s food and exports, but in the “Golden Rice Bowl,” poverty is increasing.</p>
<p>Here rice has become more expensive to produce than to sell —the result of unfavorable government policies and high costs along the production and distribution chain. Struggling farmers also face mounting pressures from changing weather patterns and the region’s intricate system of rivers and canals is being inundated with salinity from the rising ocean.</p>
<p>Rice growers in the southern provinces typically farm land that is small and fragmented, which leaves individual farmers with higher input costs and little control over supply and resulting price. Recognizing the importance of rice to Vietnam’s economy, the government instituted a floor price policy to ensure that farmers earn a 30 percent profit.</p>
<p>But enterprises rarely buy rice directly from farmers and any extra profit from higher prices goes to middle-man brokers instead. It’s a policy that’s especially damaging, said Mr. Nguyen Van Doi who manages an agricultural cooperative in Dong Thap province, because these brokers put a price squeeze on farmers, and then store and sell the product at significantly higher prices.</p>

<p>Nguyen Thi Nga lives in Kien Giang where she used to farm, but now picks up trash to make ends meet. Much of her land was lost to sea level rise and she passed on what remained to her children. Like many others in her village, she is unable to find steady work and lives in a makeshift home built near the trunk of a tree. Often when the river floods its banks, these homes are swept away, leaving Nga and her neighbors to grab their few belongings and move on.</p>
<h2>People on the move</h2>
<p>These “floating” populations are growing in number in Vietnam’s southern provinces. In addition to out-of-work farmers, there are large numbers of migrant workers who don’t have land or other skills to support their large families. Low education levels, training and available jobs are major causes of chronic poverty.</p>
<p>Nguyen Van Thoi, who lives in nearby Nam Can, has no land or farm, just a poorly constructed bamboo house that sits precariously along the riverbank. When the house collapses or washes away, his family moves to another location and rebuilds. Without any land or trade to pass on to their children, this cycle of poverty continues.</p>

<p>“Our lives here depend entirely on the rivers. [Some] days, I go fishing; on dry days…I do whatever others hire,” he said. With little rainfall over the past few months, however, earning has been difficult. In the Mekong Delta region, annual per capita income is one of the lowest in the country at $1,535 (about 34.6 million VND). The national average is just over $2,000 (46.2 million VND).</p>
<p>Professor Vu Trong Khai, an independent expert on agricultural economics and rural development, said that the rise in untrained, unemployed workers is a major challenge. Although the Mekong Delta has an abundant labor force, those who farm often do so using traditional or primitive methods, which results in the low production levels and income despite their great efforts. This also makes them vulnerable to many intermediaries, who purchase their rice at lower prices and then sell it for two to three times higher.</p>
<p>Children in the southern provinces are also suffering. According to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Education and Training, the percentage of children early dropping out of school in the Mekong Delta region is three times higher than the rest of the country. Schools in this area lack even the most basic facilities. Low education rates prevent next generations of Mekong people from accessing new skills and better opportunities, instead tying them to unstable, low-paid work in agriculture and manual production.</p>

<p>To help farmers escape from poverty, Professor Khai said it is necessary to train young laborers on professional production methods. Otherwise, the Mekong Delta will continue to rely on cheap labor and an increasingly unpredictable environment, making their source of livelihood less reliable and stable. Already, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion has caused a significant loss in viable agricultural land.</p>
<p>Many places like Dong Thap and Can Tho are especially vulnerable and have left people fleeing the advancing sea. But many lack the training and skills to find alternative jobs in the market economy or industrial goods production.</p>
<p>Warming temperatures and rising seas are threatening the second largest rice exporter in the world, but it’s the grinding poverty across the Mekong Delta region that is most visible. Without a development plan for Vietnam’s southern provinces, the lives of the people may be quickly washed away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northern Nigeria is a region of vast arable land, capable of feeding the entire country with enough left to export. Yet millions of its inhabitants have been uprooted in their own country, victims of the advancing Sahara Desert that is moving southward at a rate of 0.6 kilometers per year.</p>
<p>The resulting land deterioration leaves formerly productive fields barren and unfit for human habitation, which threatens not only food security but economic and social stability. Nigeria is one of the nations most at risk with 11 northern states at the front lines, including Kebbi, Zamfara, Gombe, Yobe, Adamawa and Bauchi.</p>
<p>Reports say that Nigeria loses at least 35,000 hectares of its arable land annually to desert encroachment in the north. This is comparable to the size of Lagos State, Nigeria&#8217;s economic capital and its most populous region. According to Alhaji Garba Sale, the Director of Forestry and Ecology in Kano State, one major consequence of northern desert encroachment is the massive migration of the people due to the loss of farmlands, a situation that puts pressure on food production in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major socio-economic impact of desert encroachment is the loss of farmlands. Immediately following that is migration syndrome because once the local population loses their farmlands, the alternative option for them is to relocate and unfortunately they relocate to urban areas,” said Sale. “By moving to the cities, we are creating more mouths to be fed while farm produce is reduced. This is a big problem. No nation can survive if this is allowed to go on.”</p>
<div id="attachment_651" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/sale.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-651" class="size-large wp-image-651" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/sale-1024x768.jpg" alt="Alhaji Garba Sale (Credit: Augustina Armstrong-Ogbonna)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-300x225.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-1020x765.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-651" class="wp-caption-text">Alhaji Garba Sale (Credit: Augustina Armstrong-Ogbonna)</p></div>
<p>A tour of some of the affected states, including Katsina, Kano, and Sokoto, reveals that rainfall—still heavy in some southern states—has been dramatically reduced, many streams have dried up and crops have withered on the vine. According to a 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), &#8220;agricultural production and food security (including access to food) in many African countries and regions are likely to be severely compromised by climate change and climate variability.”</p>
<p>A number of countries in Africa already face semi-arid conditions that make agriculture challenging and climate change will likely to reduce the length of growing season as well as eliminate large regions of formerly productive agricultural land. Projected yield reductions in some countries “could be as much as 50% by 2020, and crop net revenues could fall by as much as 90% by 2100, with small-scale farmers being the most affected.”</p>
<p>Along the border with the Niger Republic, farmers complain that crop yields have reduced by as much as 80%. Farm lands which used to produce over ten bundles of millet now can barely produce two due to ravaging deserts that are leaving a trail of poverty in their path.</p>
<p>Sambo Issah, a local leader in the farming community said that further intervention is needed from the government. Research into quick maturing crop species, for example, is critical since the rainy season has drastically shortened to about three months per year. Issah said the government has promised to create a four kilometer long shelter belt, or line or trees, to protect crop lands from harsh weather and encroaching desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are suffering here in Köngo Village, in Mai Adua Local government. Here we face many environmental problems such as erosion and desert encroachment. This has caused reduction in farm produce while some areas cannot be cultivated at all,” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rainfall keeps reducing each year. Some 10 years ago, we used to witness rainfall for at least 5-6 months and the farm harvest was impressive,” Issah said. “Now we hardly get three months of rainfall.”</p>
<h2><strong>Advancing desert fueling conflict</strong></h2>
<p>Conflict over dwindling land resources has also fueled violence between farmers and nomadic herdsmen, reportedly claiming hundreds of lives over the last five years and mounting economic losses. The group known as the Fulani herdsmen has been accused of raping women, destroying farmlands and inducing inter-ethnic violence as they move from state to state in search of viable grazing land for their flock.</p>
<p>But experts say that herders have long been neglected by federal development programs that favor agrarian farmers. “There is a National Policy on Livestock Agriculture, but that is hardly implemented,” said Mallam Ahmed Bello, a top official with the Confederation of Traditional Herder Organizations in West Africa. Traditional grazing routes, he says, have been overtaken by farmers who use the land for cultivation or information irrigation areas during the dry season. “The herdsmen are aware of the grazing corridors and they know their routes,” he said, “but when these routes are encroached on, we have conflicts.”</p>
<p>Statistics from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture show that more than half of Nigeria’s national grazing routes have been encroached upon. Actions that have sparked “a call to war,” according to Saidu Bala, a herder from Plateau state. “What do you expect from us when our source of existence is threatened?” he asked. “We have no option but to fight back.”</p>
<p>The Islamist insurgency in parts of northern Nigeria has also been linked to the advancing desert. Locals say that Boko Haram militants hide behind the instability caused by poverty and unemployment, and use hopelessness as a recruitment tool.</p>
<h2><strong>A way forward?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Experts say the time is now for the Nigerian government to execute its commitments under the Great Green Wall (GGW) project, a regional initiative to create a wall of trees and block the desert from encroaching southwards.</p>
<p>The wall of trees is expected to run across frontline areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in West Africa, through 11 states in Nigeria to Djibouti in East Africa. Ten years after the GGW project was conceived, it has yet to fully commence in Nigeria. In Katsina State, an area designated for project implementation is waiting to break ground. Trees are still in the nursery, while a solar borehole for watering the plants sits nearby.</p>
<p>But Hussaini Dangari, the Permanent Secretary for Katsina States’s Ministry of the Environment, insists that the project has fully kicked off and was positively affecting host communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katsina state has the greatest number of local governments that the GGW Program covers. The state also is contributing a lot towards the success of this project through not only funding, but also in sensitizing the public to know the importance of it,” Dangari said. “Orchards are also being established so that the communities can use them. The seedlings are raised by the communities themselves.”</p>
<p>In addition to the GGW project, many northern states have their own individual tree planting initiatives, some spanning as long as thirty years, others much newer, but the positive impact they have on farm land is clearly visible. In areas where trees have grown big enough to block the wind, crop yields were high unlike other unprotected areas, as observed in Kongo and Kano state.</p>
<p>Bold steps taken by the Nigerian government to mitigate the impact of northern desert encroachment through the GGW project, in addition to other structured tree planting initiatives and adaptation measures, is a critical step to securing a successful future for the people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the hills of Mariashoni in the eastern part of Kenya’s Mau Forest Complex, sits an old indigenous <em>Yemdit</em> tree with pale orange-green leaves.</p>
<p>A lone ranger, the tree is surrounded by fresh green commercial eucalyptus trees. A single log beehive – a traditional form of beekeeping to the region’s native population – sits firmly attached to its moss green branches.</p>
<p>This forest – almost unrecognizable – is home to Joseph Chemaina, who was born into Kenya’s indigenous Ogiek community in 1958, when the forest was thick with indigenous trees.</p>
<p>While their numbers back then were closer to 200, the Ogiek population within the Mariashoni area has jumped to approximately 1,700 people of voting age – which is 18 in Kenya – but remains only a minute representation of the estimated 15,000 adult Ogieks living in the Mau Forest Complex and 20,000 across Kenya. Because of the limited data on Ogiek families, these numbers are misleading. With an estimated average family size of ten people, the forest’s Ogiek population could actually be closer to 150,000 people.</p>
<p>“I was born in the forest and when I opened my eyes, all I saw was a forest. A thick forest; every inch you moved, a shrub or tree squeezed your shoulders,” said the 57-year-old Chemaina.</p>
<div id="attachment_186" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/The-log-beehive.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186" class="size-large wp-image-186" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg" alt="A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-186" class="wp-caption-text">A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Each family had its own territory surrounded with a canopy of trees stretching up to 100 meters high.</p>
<p>Here, high atop these branches, the Ogieks would affix log beehives, the backbone of their simple economy. Honey gathered from these hives provided a reliable source of food, income and medicine.</p>
<p>“Honey was in plenty, one Ogiek could have up to 800 beehives,” said Chemaina.</p>
<p>Bees collected nectar and pollen from the indigenous trees, which flowered in different seasons of the year due to regular rainfall and flowing streams.</p>
<p>Back then, the forest provided an abundant source of food and water for the community and Chemaina said he could pick a variety of wild fruits and hunt for rabbits under its dewy cover. Experience had taught the Ogiek to expect brief rains from February to April before the onset of heavier rainfall during the second half of the year. Never, said Chemaina, did it disappoint them.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the flowering season stretched from November to March and the honey harvest yielded ample returns.</p>
<p>“Each beehive produced more than 100 kilogrammes of honey,” he explained.</p>
<p>The Ogieks consider nectar and pollen from the indigenous <em>Tongotwet</em> and <em>Kureyet</em> trees to be very special, and used the dark brown honey as a remedy for chest, stomach, nerve and bone problems.</p>
<p>It was also used as a cure for injuries and fever in children. Expectant mothers drank the thick, dark substance like milk and it served as a disinfectant and wound sanitizer during delivery.</p>
<p>“We survived without the worry of diseases because honey was a powerful dose of medicine,” Chemaina said. But the once rich supply of these indigenous trees began to diminish after illegal logging, charcoal burning and other human activities caused extensive destruction of the forest. Rainfall patterns became less predictable and many local flowering plants started to disappear.</p>
<div id="attachment_190" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree..jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190" class="size-large wp-image-190" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-190" class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Medicinal honey is now a rarity that the Ogieks are forced to accept.</p>
<p>Chemaina now counts only 37 beehives on his 30-acre territory, compared to some 700 he had until early 1990s. “Bee keeping is my life and the life of Ogieks,” he said. “I want to have that life of dense forest back. I want a reverse of the weather patterns – to have the rains as normal.”</p>
<p>But harvesting has been reduced to once in a year and on many occasions, Chemaina has been forced to skip seasons due to lack of honey. Where he used to get 100 kilogrammes from each beehive, he now gets less than 10.</p>
<p>Despite these weather-related challenges, Chemaina said nothing will detach him from the traditional system of rearing bees. He said the demand for the special medicinal honey is even higher since cold weather ailments are affecting him and fellow community members.</p>
<p>“I still need it to help with my chest and fever. It has now become a common problem I have to deal with and hospitals were never part of our lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Augmenting these environmental stresses, the ruthless destruction of the forest over the last two decades has cost the forest community an abundance of wild rabbits, fruits and indigenous vegetation that is critical to their survival.</p>
<p>As early as 1990, people invaded the Mau forest to burn trees into charcoal, an activity that decimated the forest and drove away much of the bee population. By 2000, this damage had spread to more than 100,000 hectares of the forest.</p>
<p>According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), up to 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex’s 416,000 hectares were destroyed between 1990 and 2001.</p>
<p>Cosmas Ikiugu, head of Mau Conservancy in the Kenya Forest Service, said much of the eastern and western parts of the Mau Forest Complex were heavily degraded.</p>
<p>It’s here that more than 150,000 people – including Ogieks – have illegally settled, extending the destruction that the forestry agency admits is a challenge that requires a multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-194" class="size-large wp-image-194" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg" alt="A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-194" class="wp-caption-text">A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>High carbon emissions, soil erosion and decreased groundwater levels are only some of the byproducts of these damaging human activities.</p>
<p>“By 2008, the Mau River was actually drying up. Lake Nakuru which depends on the river was facing a major problem of low water levels,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Teresia Chemutai, a 53-year-old Ogiek woman, said the community relies on water from the Mau River during the dry period since there is no more water flowing freely under their feet.</p>
<p>Groundwater streams such as Segut, Ndoswa and Napuyapui are now extinct, she said.</p>
<p>Women, she said, never went out to hunt for wild meat, rear or harvest honey to feed their families during their days in the forest. But that has changed.</p>
<p>“There is too much work for Ogiek women nowadays. There have to walk long distances to get water, go out to look for food just as men. They bear the burden of ever sickly chicken and give birth to weak children,” she said.</p>
<p>Under bleak circumstances, the Ogiek have reluctantly moved to crop and livestock farming. But the chemical pesticides used to treat the crops is also threatening what’s left of their precious bees.</p>
<p>Chemutai said she started farming in 1997 after the government apportioned her and a few other Ogieks land in the forest. Non-Ogieks that they refer to as “invaders” also received land allocations and to date, the issue remains a grievance that the government has yet to address.</p>
<p>The Ogieks left without government-granted land started farming areas within the territories they originally inhabited.</p>
<p>Chemutai currently has three acres of maize and one of potatoes, but says the practice has been difficult to learn.</p>
<p>“I have been farming for years now, but I still feel I am not used to it,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_187" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187" class="size-large wp-image-187" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg" alt="Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-187" class="wp-caption-text">Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>And just like the trees and flowering plants that have slowly died off, their crops remain susceptible to changes in the weather patterns.</p>
<p>Dry spells threaten maize and potatoes – the main food staples now grown in this area. Many Ogieks still remember a devastating drought that struck the region in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>“We were shocked and worried over the happenings. The crops dried and very little was available for consumption,” said Joseph Barngetuny, a 56-year-old Ogiek farmer.</p>
<p>Recognizing these challenges to traditional ways of life, Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture is educating members of the Ogiek community on the practice of modern beekeeping. “Traditional beehives are no longer productive due to the changed habitat,” said Phillip Owiti, an apiculture officer with the agricultural ministry. “The bee colonies have reduced as a result of unsuitable conditions for survival.”</p>
<p>So far, he said, they have trained 275 Ogieks from Mariashoni who have embraced modern beekeeping.</p>
<p>“We are making all efforts to help them (Ogieks) change their socio-cultural attachment to the environment because the climate change is not sparing their traditional way of keeping bees,” he said.</p>
<p>But results have been mixed. Joseph Barngetuny is one of the farmers who shifted to modern beekeeping. He currently occupies 30 acres of land in Mariashoni and has eight portable beehives, which unlike the traditional log beehives can be erected on sheds or other structures around a farm.</p>

<p>Each, he said, produces no more than 10 kilogrammes of honey, a low production he partly attributes to lost bee colonies, contaminated flowering plants and lack of adequate water sources.</p>
<p>Because of the inadequate harvest, he must continue to grow maize to meet the financial needs of his 20 children from two wives. Though he consumes the honey he produces, he said it has lost the ingredients that made it a special food for the community.</p>
<p>But even more troubling still, the Ogieks lack legal claim to the land they have worked so tirelessly to till. Though they say it’s their ancestral right, it’s a subject that’s rarely mentioned or talked in community circles.</p>
<p>Nahashon Kiptoo, a member of the Ogiek Council of Elders, compared the community’s lack of title deeds to an open wound awaiting a very strong antidote to heal.</p>
<p>“I have developed ulcers imagining us being displaced from here. We fear of other people acquiring title deeds for the parcels of land we are currently occupying. That will be disastrous to us,” said Kiptoo.</p>
<p>The acquisition of title deeds is just one of their pressing needs. The Ogieks also wish for a section of the forest to be officially declared as their secluded home.</p>
<p>Kiptoo said that since their lives begin and end in the forest, they should be allowed to live freely as they did before.</p>
<p>“We will be very happy to go back to [traditional ways of life in the forest]. We miss that life of jumping from one tree to another like monkeys,” said the elder. “We were very strong. We could fall from a 100 metre tree and never died.”</p>
<p>The Ogieks also want a fresh audit of their members to determine how many are in need of title deeds. Findings of a survey done in 2010 by the Interim Mau Restoration Coordinating Secretariat are yet to be made public.</p>

<p>Joseph Towett, who participated in the survey, said the adult Ogiek population in Mau Forest Complex were originally approximated to be 11,000 people. But he puts the current figure closer to 15,000.</p>
<p>“That list is now outdated and several things have changed since then. We need title deeds, support to establish sustainable livelihoods since climate change has adversely affected our lives. We also need engagement in the conservation of Mau,” said Towett, who also chairs the Ogiek Council of Elders.</p>
<p>Ikiugu, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) official, said their concerns over land ownership and engagement in proactive conservation activities is something the government has and will continue to put effort to address.</p>
<p>“We realize that security over land gives them long-term control over the conservation activities in the area which eventually determines rate of climate change,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Ikiugu said they are encouraging the Ogieks to form Community Forest Associations through which they will legally access the benefits accrued from the forests including allocation of land in the forest for cultivation.</p>
<p>A piece of legislation passed in 2005 legalised a system of forest cultivation to forest adjacent communities. Known as the Plantation Establishment for Livelihoods Scheme (PELIS), it allows for community members to access and manage forest land. They are allowed to graze cows and plant crops on a designated plot of land for three years, as long as they also grow trees with certified seedlings provided by KFS. The seedlings are a mix of indigenous and exotic species, with limitations of what can be harvested for timber, but enforcement remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>So far, officials say that 70,000 hectares have been rehabilitated through concerted efforts between the state’s forestry agency and non-state actors, namely the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), among others.</p>
<p>Exotic species such as eucalyptus, cypress and pine have been introduced in 50,000 hectares while the rest has been restored with indigenous trees, Ikiugu said. He believes that high water levels at the Mau River swelling up Lake Nakuru and Mara River are outcomes of the intensive restoration activities at the water tower.</p>

<p>“There is an overflow of water into Lake Nakuru presently submerging houses belonging to the officials at (Lake Nakuru National Park),” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>But Timothy Kiogora, the Nakuru county environmental director, said he remains concerned over the continued practice of the harmful human activities in the forest. Dealing with it requires commitment from all stakeholders, he said.</p>
<p>“It is one thing to tell people about the effects of destroying the forests and how to conserve it but it becomes another issue in converting the information into results,” said Kiogora.</p>
<p>“For people who depend on the forest, you must be able to give them the best alternative to be able to sustainably protect the forest against any destruction,” he added.</p>
<p>The county official said they have outlined effective strategies on educating communities living in the Mau Forest Complex on use of solar and other energy saving cooking stoves to save the forest.</p>
<p>While the government strives to rehabilitate the Mau Forest Complex and assist the Ogieks in adapting to changes in the climate, the community continues to hope that the bees will return.</p>
<p>“It tells a lot about the value of our environment,” said elder council member Kiptoo. “Only by recognising the value of indigenous trees and the ecosystem they enjoyed will we have again stocks of the honey.”</p>

<p><em>Climate change is affecting people across the planet, however, it disproportionately impacts women, particularly those living in poor countries who are traditionally tasked with gathering food, water and fuel for the family. </em></p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>As climate change dries up streams and lakes, women are walking longer distances to fetch water, firewood and other domestic necessities that are vital for every day life. Farming, an activity often carried out by women in African societies, has also been affected.</p>
<p>Under searing temperatures and reduced rainfall, crops are smaller and sometimes do not grow at all. In many of these traditionally patriarchal societies, women have little influence over social and political issues. This is especially the case in northern Malawi, where women are often constrained by laws and cultural norms that limit their economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Though communities here depend on this agricultural production for both income and food, women&#8217;s access to land and ownership of land is heavily restricted. In the northern region districts of Karonga and Mzimba, for example, women are generally not allowed to own enough land for large-scale agricultural production that could promote their economic independence. Instead productive land is primarily controlled by male family members.</p>
<p>But as crops continue to struggle under the effects of climate, many women farmers have begun to lead in the practice of something known as conservation agriculture. This technology enables growers to yield much more from small pockets of land, despite warmer temperatures and erratic rains. It is, however, labor intensive and requires long hours that are often difficult to meet under the pressures of other gender-related roles.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DEk8aw07ng&amp;w=420&amp;h=315]</p>
<p>“I always wake up early in the morning searching for food for my children and I don’t find time to concentrate in the garden let alone to take part in the new ways of farming. I am aware of conservation agriculture and I know women who take part, but it’s difficult and so involving I can’t do it alone,&#8221; said Jenipher Tchongwe, who is a mother of four. She added that if she had a husband to take care of some of the family’s needs, she would have taken part in conservation agriculture.</p>
<p>Some women have started growing crops that don’t need much water, such as hybrid maize instead of local varieties They are also using manure, soil and water management, pit growing, soil cover and minimum tillage among other methods.Despite being a widow with seven children, Jessica Kaluwa, is a farmer who is leading in the practice of conservation agriculture. She began to experiment with these methods in 2012 to see if they would work.</p>
<p>“I saw others around my area doing it. I then told myself to give it a try and it really worked for me,” Kaluwa said. She added that since conservation agriculture requires so much time, one must commit. “As a woman, it’s a challenge to concentrate since there are so many other duties I have to fulfill since I have no husband to take up other challenges,&#8221; she added. But she was quick to point out that women could make more of an impact in the agricultural sector if only they had the same land ownership rights as men.</p>
<p>Winnie Ngulube is a mother of four, who is taking part in irrigation farming. She manages to harvest twice a year and she gets all her financial needs from the activity.</p>
<p>“Irrigation farming is another way of farming which Malawians need to focus on. I have managed to raise my kids alone through this way of farming. I harvest twice a year crops like maize, sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes and I mostly sell the produce,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One advocate for women&#8217;s land rights is Chief Kyungu, a prominent leader in Karonga who is working hard to change views on land ownership. Kyungu mandated that under his jurisdiction, women could inherit their husbands’ lands.</p>
<p>“Land distribution culturally favors men since it is believed that they are bread winners. People forget that women are more responsible when it comes to family matters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are taking advantage of the current gender sensitization to change people’s mindsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security has been working on leveling the playing field for both men and women by taking legal action against those who refuse to pass land to women land through the introduction of property grabbing laws. These laws are designed to protect women, but are often subverted due to fear and intimidation in rural regions.</p>
<p>The Malawian government has also introduced so-called &#8220;50:50 campaigns&#8221; where all farmers, male or female, are given the same opportunity in taking farming roles and sponsorship. Gordon Yiwombe from the Ministry of Agriculture emphasized that things are now changing in order to help women farmers overcome long-held restrictions to land ownership.</p>
<p>“In my experience in the field of agriculture and gender,&#8221; said Yiwombe, who works as the principal gender roles and extension support services officer for the ministry, &#8220;I have observed that women farmers produce more than men if they are given the same support despite facing challenges connected to gender roles.&#8221;</p>
<div style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.mbc.mw/images/YIWOMBE.bmp" alt="" width="360" height="288" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gordon Yiwombe, Nigeria&#8217;s Ministry of Agriculture</p></div>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">Evidence on the ground shows that women are feeding Malawi despite the challenges of traditional societal roles and gender-based restrictions. Despite this progress, women remain vulnerable to rigid societal roles, which limits their ability to practice climate-resilient agriculture. Without these important changes, it will become more difficult for them to produce enough food to feed their families.</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">If Malawi wants to seek solutions to changing climatic conditions, it should empower its women to lead the way.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The rains didn’t start until June this year,” says Laadi Danladi, clutching water leaves in her hands as she peered across her fields. “By June or July, we should have started harvesting and eating. But now things have changed.” Danladi, a member of Nigeria’s Gbagyi indigenous group, has been farming for four years, but like other rural women employed in the country’s agricultural sector, she faces growing threats from warming temperatures and erratic rainfall.</p>
<p>Across Africa, climate change is having a major impact on agricultural production and food security, but in rural Nigeria where women make up over 60% of the sector, its disrupting livelihoods and traditional practices.</p>
<div id="attachment_534" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-image-534 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png" alt="LAADI DANLADI" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-caption-text">Gbagyi farmer Laadi Danladi says the weather patters are changing. &#8220;By June or July we should have started harvesting and eating, but now things have changed.&#8221; (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>The Gbagyi nation is an ethnic group found in north-central Nigeria. According to National Population Census figures, there is an estimated population of 5.8 million spread across four states: Kaduna, Nassarawa, Niger, Kwara as well as Abuja, the federal capital. They are traditionally farmers, hunters and craftsmen.</p>
<p>Women play a significant role in Gbagyi society and are typically responsible for about 70% of household food production, as well as child rearing, but they remain a marginalized group in Nigeria as they attempt to adapt to the changing climate.</p>
<h2><strong>Unpredictable rain, unreliable harvest<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The Gbgayi women primarily practice subsistence agriculture, which means that they produce enough to feed themselves and their families. Warming temperatures and changes to the yearly rain cycle, however, are disrupting these customary methods. Typically the rainy season starts in spring, but each year seems to bring a later start and inconsistent rainfall for crops.</p>
<p>Like Danladi, 25-year-old bean farmer Godiah Williams is also a member of Nigeria’s Gbagyi minority. She says the unsteady, unpredictable weather patterns have caused the farmers financial ruin.</p>
<p>“We need the government to come and help us with money and fertilizer, so we can farm well, and send our children to school.”</p>
<div id="attachment_542" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/AT-WORK.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" class="size-large wp-image-542" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/AT-WORK-768x1024.jpg" alt="A Gbagyi woman working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="760" height="1013" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-225x300.jpg 225w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-542" class="wp-caption-text">A Gbagyi woman working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>In some cases, it’s not just the lack of rain that’s causing problems for Gbgayi farmers.</p>
<p>“Last year, the rains came late and the volume was too much. Many of our crops including guinea corn and even yams did not turn out well. They came out small and spoilt,” laments Salamatu, a Gbagyi farmer in Lugbe, a satellite town outside the federal capital, Abuja.</p>
<p>Many women in this region blame the climactic shift on the actions of a higher power and say they are praying to God to help them through the crisis. For others, like yam farmer Kande James, they are not even sure it exists and blame bad weather as a sort of punishment for bad habits.</p>
<p>“It’s only you educated people that talk about climate change,” says James. “We inflict this situation on ourselves. When people steal from farms where they have not planted, what do you expect; we are the ones bringing it upon ourselves.”</p>
<div id="attachment_538" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-538" class="size-full wp-image-538" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png" alt="Kande James says she isn't sure climate change exists (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-538" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;We inflict this situation on ourselves,&#8221; says Kande James when talking about the changing weather patterns  (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>John Baaki, a programme officer with the Abuja-based Women Environmental Programme, has worked with rural women in north-central Nigeria and says greater access to information and data is key to overcoming climactic challenges.</p>
<p>“In order to save them the stress of predicting wrongly, it’s better to rely on the information given by the meteorological agency,” he says. “We always advocate that NIMET (the Nigerian Meteorological Agency) should partner closely with the media.”</p>
<h2><strong>Conditions driving conflict<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>It’s not just the weather patterns affecting the harvest of Nigeria’s Gbagyi farmers. Herdsmen from the country’s hard-hit northern fringes are slowly pushing south, creating greater competition for land, as reduced rainfall leaves little for their cattle to eat. With increased land scarcity and limited agronomical potential, unprecedented conflicts have erupted between local farmers and nomadic herdsmen.</p>
<p>In the Lugbe area of Abuja, herdsmen can be seen moving across the land in search of pasture. While each refused to speak to us, the farmers said they are responsible for the chronic destruction and theft of crops. Kande James says that virtually all the yams she planted that season had been stolen. They had not even matured.</p>
<p>Priscilla Achakpa, the Director of the Women Environmental Programme, says that migrating herdsmen should return to grazing routes and reserves that were proposed by the Nigerian government, a policy which has not been enforced over the years. But she acknowledges that efforts to implement adaptation strategies have been poor and often lack local context. “Most of the time,” she says, “politicians and policies that are being made ignore the indigenous knowledge of these women.”</p>
<h2>Searching for solutions</h2>
<p>As the popular saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. In circumstances of vulnerability, poverty and limited resources, many Gbagyi women have attempted to mitigate the effects of changing weather patterns on their harvests. One farmer, Patience Daniel, cut tree branches to cover her yams and prevent them from dying before the rains came. But these basic innovations are often inadequate and do little to keep crops from withering on the vine.</p>
<div id="attachment_539" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539" class="size-full wp-image-539" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png" alt="Kande James working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-539" class="wp-caption-text">Kande James working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>Kande James took these efforts a bit further by seeking out more dry climate-resistant crops. “[One] species of yam that grows well is the makakusa and that’s the one I have planted,” she says.</p>
<p>Corn farmer Salamatu also revealed that she was experimenting with new types of crops to combat warmer temperatures. “Agric maize (genetically modified maize) dries easily,” she says, “but our native species can withstand the heat.”</p>
<p>In a bid to ensure food security, Nigeria’s Ministry of Environment has initiated programmes that are aimed at simplifying climatic information for rural farmers – particularly women. They hope these efforts will enable them make informed decisions and safeguard their livelihoods.</p>
<p>These initiatives are also attempting to create awareness about climate change among Nigeria’s rural youth. Already, a group of ICT savvy young people has starting building “The Hive,” a SMS app that establishes paths of communication with rural women farmers to disseminate climate information and provide data on trends and predictions.</p>
<div id="attachment_545" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-545" class="size-full wp-image-545" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png" alt="Gbagyi women tending to the fields (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-545" class="wp-caption-text">Gbagyi women tending to the fields (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>In a 2015 address, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared that “rural women are the backbone of sustainable livelihoods and provide food security for their families and communities.” But these women often face difficulties when it comes to obtaining critical financial resources, capacity-building activities and technologies. This lack of information and access often prevents them from taking a leadership role in climate change adaptation and mitigation in their communities. Women are also often underrepresented in the decision-making process on climate change strategies at local and international levels, painfully limiting their ability to contribute, implement solutions and apply their expertise.</p>
<p>For Gbagyi women, being better informed of climactic data and the causes and effects of climate change is essential to helping them manage finite resources and adapt their livelihood strategies to a changing environment.</p>

<p>These days, it feels to Salam like his soil is fighting him. It’s quick to dry out, turning hard and gray.

<p>But there’s nothing to be done about it, and there’s no one to complain to here in Kafr el-Sheikh, in the center of Egypt’s Nile Delta, so Salam carries on planting. He, his wife and his 15-year-old son, Mohammed, scatter the wheat seeds around his 2-acre field. Their neighbor then drives his tractor through it, tilling the soil and pushing the seeds deep into the ground. Once that’s done, they all have tea and wait.</p>
<p>“The harvest will be in five or six months, <em>inshallah</em> [God willing],” Salam says. “One [acre] used to yield 18 or 20 <em>ardab</em> [worth about $1000]. But now we’ll probably only get 10.” Salam will sell half of that at market for about $250, and the other half his wife will mill into flour and bake into bread. But it’s nearly impossible to make such a small amount of flour stretch until the next harvest, she says.</p>
<p>This land, where the Nile spreads out to meet the sea, once grew enough wheat to feed everyone from Cairo to Rome—the breadbasket of the world, they called it. Today, the delta barely feeds the farmers who cultivate it. Salam blames his diminishing returns on rising fertilizer prices and bad luck.</p>
<p>But it’s not bad luck—it’s the sea. It’s warming, rising and expanding onto the low-lying, delta lands and seeping into the water that feeds them. By the end of the century, <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">60 percent</a> of the delta region—including Salam’s field—will be so saturated with salt as to be barely farmable. As much as <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">20 percent</a> of this once-fertile land will be covered in water. When this happens, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/21/climate-change-nile-flooding-farming">two-thirds</a> of Egypt’s food will drown and two-thirds of the country’s <a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/10/10873/2013/hessd-10-10873-2013-print.pdf">population</a> will be left homeless and hungry.</p>
<h2><strong>The salt shakedown<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Sadek Mahmoud has been working the plot next to Salam’s for 65 years. He remembers when the Nile used to flood his irrigation canals every year with clear, nutrient-rich water. “I used to drink from the Nile right here. And I never ever got sick,” Mahmoud says.</p>
<p>For centuries, farmers relied solely on the Nile to water their cropland, digging a complex network of irrigation canals to connect the entire delta region to the river and its tributaries. But as Egypt’s population has soared, so has its water consumption; and as factories, power plants and megacities have emerged along the Nile’s banks, the clear, rich water of Mahmoud’s youth has been fouled by all manner of human, chemical and industrial waste. Nowadays, by the time the Nile reaches Salam and Mahmoud’s fields, it has been reduced to a brown, toxic trickle.</p>
<p>To compensate, the farmers in the area have dug a well. Salam and Mahmoud, along with about a dozen of their neighbors, take turns running a fuel-powered pump to flood their respective irrigation canals with water from the <a href="https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mXCqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;dq=nile+delta+aquifer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CNUqnxVmFP&amp;sig=fo96poV9yBUodDFZBBUGOBJwKC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI2uuoy6WDyQIVzLIUCh3vAQ8N#v=onepage&amp;q=nile%20delta%20aquifer&amp;f=false">Nile Delta aquifer</a>, a massive underground reservoir, spanning from Cairo to the Mediterranean Sea.  On the surface, this seems like a good solution to the delta’s water shortage problem, but this sort of pumping is accelerating the region’s demise, according to Badr Mabrouk, a hydrology professor at Zagazig University. “When you draw the water up from the deep aquifers, it creates pressure and it draws the sea in,” Mabrouk said.</p>
<p>Rising sea levels had already put the Nile Delta aquifer in peril before farmers began deep-well pumping, Mabrouk explained, but they have made it worse. The way coastal aquifers work is that they meet and hold back the sea underground at a point called the transition zone: The higher density saltwater sinks and gets pulled back toward the ocean and the freshwater remains on top. As long as sea levels—and aquifer levels—remain stable, this meeting point doesn’t move.</p>
<p>But if either the sea rises or the fresh water recedes, this point moves farther inland: The sea advances underground. In the case of the Nile Delta, both are happening and they’re happening quickly, Mabrouk said. As the ocean warms and its waters expand, sea levels in Egypt are rising, and the land is sinking at a rate of 0.1 inches per year as a result, according to the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa Program</a>. Meanwhile, excessive pumping is draining the aquifer faster than rainfall can refill it.</p>

<p>Climate scientists and geologists have been warning of the danger of saltwater intrusion in Egypt’s Delta for decades. But in a country riven with political upheaval and economic insecurity, the environment has never been the government’s priority—and still isn’t, according to Hassan Husseiny, a water management specialist for the American University in Cairo’s <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Sustainability/Rise/Pages/Home.aspx">Research Institute for Sustainable Environment</a>. “Studies say climate change could begin to have a real effect after 20 years,” Husseiny says. “The government doesn’t look that far ahead.”</p>
<p>But up in the northern Delta region, sea-level rise is no longer a matter of looking ahead: On a daily basis, the sea is pounding away at the populous cities of Alexandria, Damietta and Port Said. If the sea rises by even 20 inches (which <a href="http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise">a 2014 National Climate Assessment</a> projects will likely occur by 2100) <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">30 percent of Alexandria</a>, a city of 5 million, will be inundated.</p>
<p>In the popular coastal resort town of Baltim, about 30 miles north of Kafr el-Sheikh, mango farmer Mossad Abu Ghali has seen the sea advancing. “I remember when they had to build a new boardwalk because the old one got ruined by the sea,” Abu Ghali says. “That was a long time ago though. Inshallah, the sea is not advancing anymore.” Baltim built a seawall in 1992 out of large, concrete tetrapod blocks. This has slowed—but not stopped—the sea’s advance. This type of structure, known as a <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/statclim/whatcanbedone.html">revetment</a>, has an average life span of 30 to 50 years. Already the wall is half-buried in sand.</p>
<p>All along the coast, cities and towns like Baltim have constructed sea walls to try and hold back the water, but even with these measures in place, Husseiny predicted that no fewer than 10 million people would be displaced in the next 30 years.</p>
<h2><strong>The Delta’s eleventh hour</strong></h2>
<p>In 1972, Egypt launched the Coastal Research Institute (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Coastal-Research-Institute-Cori-436770736371496/info/?tab=overview">CORI</a>) to “monitor and protect” the Egyptian coast, but to date, its work has focused far more on monitoring than protecting. “There has yet to be any action taken in the delta that I know of,” Husseiny said. “There have been conferences and meetings and discussions but no action.”</p>
<p>The institute’s current flagship program is a joint venture started in 2009 with the United Nations Development Program and Global Environment Facility. The project is to create “<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/dam/egypt/docs/Environment%20and%20Energy/Climate%20Change%20Project%20Document.pdf">integrated coastal zone management systems</a>” on Egypt’s coasts by building sea barriers out of natural materials. Six years and <a href="http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/sccf-czm-egypt">$4 million later</a>, they have managed to “select a pilot site,” design an “adaptation technique” and solicit bids from contractors to work on a pilot site—but have <a href="http://www.eg.undp.org/content/egypt/en/home/operations/projects/environment_and_energy/project_sample.html">yet to build</a> a single sea barrier.</p>
<p>Aymen el-Gamal, CORI’s deputy director, works out of an office less than half a mile from the sea, and he doesn’t deny the sea levels are rising. But, he says, there is little use in trying to predict the rate at which it will rise—and there’s no sense in planning more  than one or two years ahead. Most existing models are just alarmist and unhelpful, el-Gamal says. He’s also unconvinced human-induced climate change is real. “The Earth is very clever. It can take in energy and emit it,” el-Gamal says. “There are those who say there is the greenhouse effect and the ozone—no, the Earth is bigger than all of this.” His smile is confident and kind. “So the climate change from my point of view is a normal phenomenon.” Which is why he sees his role as one of simply monitoring sea-level rise and adapting to the data as it comes in.</p>
<p>For farmers like Salam, Mahmoud and Abu Ghali, however, that won’t work. The hour is late for the delta. “The land is slowly, slowly running out of time,” Mabrouk said. Egypt’s primary food source is sinking into the sea while its government—and the international community—watches on.</p>

<p>Global leaders are gearing up for the landmark COP21 climate change summit in Paris, where they are hoping to reach consensus on a new set of regulations for greenhouse gas emissions to replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2020. But even the most aggressive of global reforms won’t do a thing to save Egypt’s Nile Delta. Even if global leaders succeed in their goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (an ambitious goal to begin with), the seas are expected to continue rising for decades to come, according to a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/071615-international-report-confirms-2014-was-earths-warmest-year-on-record.html">report</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.</p>
<p>Land loss and damage from climate change are on the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/session/9057.php">agenda</a> for the summit, but it’s unlikely that Egypt’s case will be discussed specifically. Ultimately, the United Nations Framework for Climate Change has left it to individual countries to develop their own <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/workstreams/national_adaptation_plans/items/6057.php">National Adaptation Plans</a>. Egypt’s prime minister formed a <a href="http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/07/17/egypt-to-form-national-climate-change-council/">National Committee on Climate Change</a> in July to draft an up-to-date national strategy for combatting the problem, but a copy of this strategy has not been made public (if indeed it has been fully drafted).</p>
<p>In the meantime, there has been little if any international pressure on Egypt to update its national strategy expediently. All international critiques of Egypt tend to focus on the country’s national security problems, human rights abuses and poor democratic governance. As long as climate change remains a second-tier issue for the international community, the Egyptian state—and its people—will also regard it as one.</p>
<p>Even Abu Ghali, whose mango trees could be floating in saltwater within his lifetime, believes tackling climate change should come second to tightening security and restoring the economy. He has full confidence his president will help him in due time. “The government is under a lot of pressure,” Abu Ghali says. “We can’t expect everything to come all at once. [President Abdel-Fattah ] el-Sissi needs to first give jobs to people who need them. Later, he will help us.” Inshallah.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the roof of their home was brought crashing down in a planned demolition, Ma Guoqing and his family set off to start their new life. Ma, 31, was leaving the village of Luziwo in the northern Chinese province of Ningxia, where he lived with his parents, his wife and his son.</p>
<p>They knew nothing of their new home, as he’d been given only a new key and the address. So on a cold and clear December day in 2013, only two days after definite notice of relocation was issued, they set off in a large convoy of trucks hired by the government to move the villagers. They left the mountains in the south of Ningxia and headed for the plains of the north, leaving behind a village of broken old homes.</p>
<p>Ma and his family’s move was just one small part of plans by Ningxia officials to relocate 350,000 people. Residents are being forced to abandon their homes in an area that is becoming increasingly sandy, where the environment is fragile, rain is rare, and natural disasters frequent.</p>
<div id="attachment_436" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-436" class="size-full wp-image-436" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1.jpg" alt="This Chinese language graphic from thepaper.cn charts the movements of villagers from arid areas of southern Ningxia to northern parts of the province " width="630" height="804" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1.jpg 630w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1-235x300.jpg 235w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1-627x800.jpg 627w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-436" class="wp-caption-text">This Chinese language graphic from thepaper.cn charts the movements of villagers from arid areas of southern Ningxia to northern parts of the province</p></div>
<p>The parched loess plateau is also one of China’s poorest regions. Better known as Xihaigu, in 1972 it was named by the UN World Food Programme as one of the world’s most uninhabitable places.</p>
<p>Today, Xihaigu is the site of an ecological restoration scheme in which entire villages are to be emptied. When residents leave, their homes are demolished, even with neighbouring homes still occupied. Deputy head of the Ningxia Relocation Bureau, Guo Jianfan, says this new policy aims for more decisive relocations than in the past.</p>
<p>Authorities justify the harsh moves, saying people relocated to other areas often drift back, dividing their time between old and new homes, making it difficult to manage movements of population and restore vulnerable ecology such as grasslands.</p>
<p>Luziwo village is named after the reeds that grow in a hollow up in a mountain gully, where the soil is so salty crystals lie on the ground like snow. Located in Xiji county, part of Guyuan city in southern Ningxia, droughts there can last years, and new arrivals find their throats dry up and crack, just like the soil.</p>
<p>So how dry is it? Figures from the county meteorological bureau put the average annual rainfall at between 200 and 650 millimetres – but that is far outstripped by annual evaporation figures, of between 1,500 and 2,000 millimetres.</p>
<p>Access to water is the focus of village life. The first daily chore is to direct donkeys to the well and haul back water that is then stored in underground cisterns.</p>
<p>While younger villagers are keen to leave and escape poverty, and outsiders are unlikely to choose to live here, the area is still overpopulated.</p>
<p>Ma Zhongyu, former deputy head of the Ningxia Development and Reform Commission, says the south of the province can only support about 1.3 million people – compared with the 2.3 million living there currently. Overpopulation, he says, exacerbates poverty and environmental damage.</p>
<p>A relocation programme was launched in 2011 in order to reduce pressure on the environment as part of the 12th Five-Year Plan. Luziwo was chosen as one of the villages from which residents were relocated, moving to a village 500 kilometres north in Pingluo county, located near Miaomiao lake.</p>
<p>Although relocations only began in the past few years, Ningxia’s arid climate is by no means a recent phenomenon, said Wang Yiming, a professor at Ningxia University’s School of Resources and the Environment.</p>
<p>“The arid environment of the north-west of China started to take shape around 65 million years ago,” explained Wang. “The formation of the Himalayas greatly increased the height of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and aridity increased.”</p>
<p>But climate change does seem to be making things worse.</p>
<p>Research by the Ningxia Meteorological Bureau has found average temperatures here have increased by 2.2C over the last 50 years, with droughts and other extreme weather events becoming more frequent.</p>
<p>That compares with an average global increase in land surface temperatures by 0.85C over the last 130 years, according to the UN&#8217;s climate science panel.</p>
<p>In some areas, increased temperatures can lead to more rainfall, but Ningxia’s arid conditions and impact of global warming will result in increased evaporation, so any extra precipitation will be lost, says climate expert Lin Erda.</p>
<p>A joint study into climate change adaptation in China, carried out in 2010 by China, the UK and Switzerland, found that agriculture in central and southern Ningxia relies on precipitation, rather than irrigation.</p>
<p>Climate change has seen grain yields per mu (a Chinese unit of land measurement) fall to only about 30 kilogrammes, while climate disasters are increasing crop losses.</p>
<p>Statistics for 2005 from the Ministry of Environmental Protection show 95% of China’s poor live in areas with extremely fragile environments – areas particularly sensitive to climate change.</p>
<p>He remembers that during the time of people’s communes, any land that could be cultivated was exploited, and even mountaintops were used to try to grow crops and increase harvests.</p>
<p>“The springs didn’t give much water to start with, and after a few years the ones high up failed and new ones had to be dug lower down.”</p>
<p>The Hulu river that once rose in the southern foothills of Ningxia’s Yueliang mountains is now just a dried-up riverbed.</p>
<p>Manager of Xiji county’s water company, Gao Yujie, blames overdevelopment and global warming. He says just 20 years ago the river was lined with trees, “I played in the river when I was a kid,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Parts of that dried-up river bed are now celery fields as prices for the crop have risen in the last few years, meaning the water-hungry vegetable is much more widely planted. Gao says he understands but disapproves of this choice: “Those of us who study water know this is a problem, but growing celery does increase incomes for farmers.”</p>
<p>The fragile environment forces more use of natural resources to increase harvests, meaning poverty, population, environment all become interlinked.</p>
<p>Wang Yiming explains that relocations are intended to reduce demand for natural resources – mainly water – to a sustainable level. It isn’t about retreating, Wang says, it’s a necessary compromise between humankind and nature.<br />
And in the parts of Xiji emptied a year or more ago, alfalfa – an important source of forage for livestock – and wild grasses now sprout up into the warm air.</p>
<h2>New homes, new problems</h2>
<p>But life in the new villages isn’t as good as was hoped. In some cases, the new homes are smaller than those relocated villagers have left, while newer residents complain about problems with bureaucracy, farming, jobs, and other sources of income.</p>
<p>Fan Jianrong, a professor at the Beifang University of Nationalities, who has researched relocation of communities, finds that older villagers are the most despondent about the prospect of moving and have the biggest problems in adapting to new homes.</p>
<p>Guoqing’s uncle Ma Cunzi is 45, for instance, and wants to stay in Luziwo despite a final government ultimatum to leave. He even planted potatoes and wheat as soon as the weather was right.</p>
<p>The family’s new home is in Miaomiao Lake’s District 7. His mother, Ma Cuifang, has been here for several months, but doesn’t like to leave the village as she can’t read and doesn’t know many of the neighbours. His father, Ma Bingwu, spends his time thinking about the cows and fields he used to have.</p>
<p>Now, he says, he’s “useless” to the family. He rides a borrowed bike to the vegetable market, but comes home empty-handed and complaining about the prices. “It’s all more expensive here than in Xiji. It was 0.50 yuan for a kilogramme of potatoes there, and 1 yuan here!”</p>
<p>And it is not just older people that can’t settle here. Younger residents have become increasingly anxious about jobs and opportunities.</p>
<p>The town’s Party secretary’s home is full of people who come to ask about work or complain of various problems.</p>
<p>“The government moved us here, and now we don’t know what we’re meant to be doing,” says someone in the crowd, to general agreement.</p>
<p>Wang Xinglong of the Pingluo county labour and employment bureau explained that “on one hand you’ve got companies in the area that can’t find the workers they need, and on the other hand, many relocated villagers can’t secure suitable work.”</p>
<p>The government’s decision to cut off transport and logistical links to villagers’ original homes has caused controversy amongst academics.</p>
<p>Meng Huixin, a post-doctoral student at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ Institute of Urban Development and the Environment, said success of the Ningxia relocation effort will be crucial for China to demonstrate capacity to adapt to climate change.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jordan Valley, which encompasses modern day Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, has long been considered the region’s food basket. But the once cascading waters of the Jordan River – the lifeblood of its fertile grounds – have been reduced in many places to a mere trickle, victim of transboundary squabbling over water rights that is devastating the traditional livelihoods of the region’s Palestinian farmers.</p>
<p>Now it’s climate change that is exacting a heavy toll.</p>
<p>Captured by the Israelis from Jordan in 1967, the valley has become a central issue in recent peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. To Israel, it’s as a critical piece of their defense and intelligence capabilities, while many Palestinians say the occupation isn’t about security, but access to resources. According to World Bank estimates, tight Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to agricultural land and water resources in the Jordan Valley is costing the Palestinian economy more than $700 million per year.</p>
<p>But historically low rainfall rates and warming temperatures are placing additional pressure on disputed water resources. In recent years, dozens of aquifers have dried up and many fear the Jordan Valley, which lies 100 to 450 meters below sea level, will turn into an arid desert if water is eventually depleted.</p>

<p>According to a recent report issued by the Palestinian Environmental Center, this past summer was the hottest in decades. Temperatures rose 10 degrees Celsius over monthly averages in Jericho and other parts of the Jordan Valley, in some cases surpassing 50ºC (about 122ºF).</p>
<p>For the valley’s Palestinian farmers, water is already a scarce commodity. Many say there is often not enough water for basic necessities, let alone enough for their livestock or to practice traditional year-round cultivation.</p>
<p>“About 20 years ago, agriculture flourished in my village and we were self-sufficient,” says Mahmoud Saleh Suleiman, a 64-year-old farmer. “But during the past few years, water started to gradually dry up for many reasons.” One of those reasons, he believes, is climate change. “Especially in summer,” he says, “the temperature has increased, drying up water aquifers.”</p>
<p>The head of the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, Adalah Atiri, says that prevailing drought conditions are having a major impact in the West Bank, in turn affecting the food and agricultural sector. “We assume the worst possibilities to enable us to tackle issues such as a fall in rainfall of 10-20 percent by 2020 as a result of climate change,” Atiri says, “Work is needed to find solutions and adapt to these changes.”</p>
<h2>Challenging political environment</h2>
<p>But any solutions that ignore the complex political realities on the ground are insufficient.</p>
<p>Approximately 80,000 Palestinians live in the Jordan Valley, but strict Israeli measures restrict them from accessing 94 percent of available land, according to a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. Instead, Israel has allocated the majority of the valley’s land, about 86 percent, to regional councils who protect the interests of its 9,500 Israeli settlers. According to World Bank estimates, each settler receives an average of 300 liters per capita per day, about four times the amount available to Palestinians across the West Bank.</p>
<p>Villages that used to sustainably produce crops have seen their once abundant supplies of water dry up, much of it diverted to the nearby farms of Israeli settlers. Wells are often antiquated and in desperate need of repair, but it’s difficult to get the necessary permits to fix them as many lie in Area C – a security zone where Israel maintains full control.</p>
<p>In Suleiman’s hometown of Fasayel, more than 95 percent of the village’s 2,000 residents are farmers, but due to chronic water shortages, local agricultural production has ceased completely. Many now work for Israeli farms along the outskirts of the town, an industry that has been sharply criticized by human rights groups for labor violations.</p>
<p>“While the village population has doubled during the last twenty years,” Suleiman says, “our share of water has remained the same and we are obliged to buy water to meet our daily needs, as well as needs for cultivation.” But this resource comes at a steep price.</p>

<p>Dr. Abdel Rahman Tamimi, director of the Palestinian Hydology Group, says that continuous reductions in water supplies have forced Palestinians to buy water from the Israeli authorities at inflated prices. The price of one cubic meter of treated water is 5 shekels, Tamimi says, “but the Israelis take advantage of Palestinian demand for water and sell it at 25 shekels for one cubic meter, especially in Hebron and the Jordan Valley area, where people spend around 12 percent of their monthly income on water.”</p>
<p>According to Tamimi, factors such as climate change and Israeli control over supply have restricted daily individual consumption from an average of 80 liters to only 40. In some cases it’s much less, but each is below the 100 liters per day recommended by the World Health Organization. “In southern Hebron,” he says, “the per capita share of water is only 10 liters and people in that area are obliged to buy water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmer Youself Sawafta owns several <em>dunums </em>of land in Bardala (each <em>dunum </em>is equal to 100 square meters), the lowest agricultural strip on earth. The last three years, he says, have been some of the most difficult due to the adverse effects of hot weather on agriculture and water supplies. Despite his best efforts to reduce reliance on water-intensive crops, his output remains meager. “For more than a year, we have been trying to cultivate crops that do not need much water, such as barley,” he says. “We barely have sufficient water for our daily use, let alone cultivation.”</p>
<p>Sawafta says that tight restrictions on what little water is available for agriculture only makes things worse. “In the past, we were allowed to extract 400 cubic meters per hour,” he says. “The occupation allocated us only 80 cubic meters per hour, which is insufficient to cultivate any type of vegetable.”</p>
<div id="attachment_386" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/7-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386" class="size-full wp-image-386" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/7-5.jpg" alt="A well in Bardah that is controlled by the Israeli water company Makarot (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-386" class="wp-caption-text">A well in Bardalah that is controlled by the Israeli water company Mekorot (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>What does remain is cost prohibitive for most Palestinian farmers. Sawafta says his annual water bill is more than 100 thousand shekels (approximately $26,000) and he depends on help from international aid organizations to cover the bill. But it’s a high sum for the poor agricultural region, where the average annual per capita income is $2,000.</p>
<p>According to Sawafta, Israeli authorities have reduced the volume of water allocated to Bardala since 2000 in order to supply nearby settlements. Two wells built before 1967 to provide the village with water are fitted with meters to monitor use. A guard, he says, prevents anyone from approaching them. Deeper wells dug by Israel’s National Water Company, Mekorot, are close by.</p>
<h2>A region-wide problem?</h2>
<p>Mekorot director Ori Shani disputes the notion that Israel is the cause of water shortages faced by Palestinians. Severe drought, he says, is putting pressure not only on the West Bank, but also Israel and other neighboring countries. “Climate change has affected the volume of water and the seasons,” says Shani, “some seasons have become longer than others, causing drought in certain areas and less water in springs, a phenomenon that did not previously exist.”</p>
<p>He says visible impacts such as reduced water levels in the Sea of Galilee (Tiberias Lake) have prompted both sides to seek solutions, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been negligent in its approach to solving the crisis.</p>
<p>“The PA has not attempted to reduce water consumption by the public and has also failed to implement any projects to tackle the water shortage, such as the treatment of wastewater for cultivation purposes,” he says. “This can reduce the water shortage by 30 percent, exactly as it has done in Israel.”</p>
<p>Reduced water to villages is therefore not a problem with supply, he says, but with demand. “We supply Palestinians with double the quantity of water stipulated in agreements signed between Palestinians and Israelis,” says Shani, “the quantity of water supplied to areas inside the Green Line is much higher than that supplied to settlements.”</p>
<p>Humanitarian organizations estimate that 100,000 <em>dunums</em> of agricultural land in the Jordan Valley is affected by water shortages, forcing many farmers each year to pack up and leave. Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) head Mazen Ghneim acknowledges that climate change has played a role in reducing underground aquifers and increasing drought, but says the crisis would be greatly reduced if Israel ceased control over the valley’s water supply. According to PWA estimates, the average Palestinian in the Jordan Valley receives an average daily share of 30 liters, compared to the daily per capita share of 500 liters for an Israeli settler.</p>
<div id="attachment_389" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389" class="size-full wp-image-389" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8-3.jpg" alt="An outdated Palestinian well in Bardalah (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-389" class="wp-caption-text">An outdated Palestinian well in Bardalah (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>The way Ghneim sees it, Palestinians face few choices – either buy water back from Israel at inflated prices or attempt to renovate outdated wells. The second option is difficult and requires approval from the Israeli government, he says, which comes few and far between. But Mekorot’s Ori Shani says that it’s the Palestinian Authority government that’s been slow to begin approved renovations. “In the Joint Palestinian-Israeli Water Committee,” he says, “we Israelis agreed to renovate 60 wells in the West Bank, but the PA has not yet started the implementation of these projects.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that there is no simple solution to easing water woes in the Jordan Valley. Despite their low carbon footprint, Palestinians also have little control over emissions that climate scientists say are warming the planet and contributing to the warmer temperatures and prolonged drought, conditions that Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority head Atir says makes them doubly victimized.</p>
<p>“Emissions produced by Palestine are almost zero as Palestine does not have factories,” she says. “Israel also does not allow Palestinians to exploit underground water aquifers located within their land, which is a double blow.”</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Yumao is a community in the Bolivian Great Chaco where women and children must walk up to eight kilometers a day to collect water from the Rio Grande, an increasingly complicated feat in times of a changing climate.
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lupe Cuellar awoke to the noisy singing of a group of <em>charatas</em>, a bird native to the Chaco region. It was time to set off for the Rio Grande before the afternoon sun made the trip unbearable.</p>
<p>Each morning, she makes the three to four hour journey to collect enough water to meet her family’s daily needs. As she prepares to leave, the family’s 23-year-old donkey <em>Jincho</em> stands by her side with two empty containers strapped to his back, just about all the aging animal can carry home.</p>
<p>Outside, her three young boys play in the dusty yard with the family’s chickens. They are too young to make the journey, but her eldest son Roberto Carlos has finished his homework and will accompany her on the long trip. He is ten years old.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1raRdgUckE&#038;w=560&#038;h=315]</p>
<p>The 22 families living in Yumao are considered to be some of the poorest in Bolivia, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The community is located in the municipality of Gutierrez in the Bolivian Great Chaco, home to 44 indigenous communities. About 90 percent of the municipality´s population belongs to the Guarani ethnic group. Yumao has the lowest rate of income per household and lacks basic needs such as food, water, and sanitation.</p>
<p>Lupe is not alone on her long trek to the Rio Grande. Every day, Yumao women must walk an average of six to eight daily kilometers, some even up to 15 kilometers, to collect drinking water. Some must make the journey twice to collect enough water for their families and farm animals, as well as to cook and clean. This daily feat far exceeds World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that say water sources must be less than a thousand meters from home and collection time should not exceed 30 minutes.</p>
<p>A person needs between 50 and 100 liters of water per day to ensure that basic health needs are met and an additional two liters a day are required for safe food preparation. In Yumao, one person must survive on an average of 13 liters of water per day—37 liters less than the minimum established.</p>
<h2><strong>Not a drop to waste</strong></h2>
<p>“Each drop of water is worth a lot to us, we do not waste anything,” says Braulio Alvarez after returning from a second trip to get enough water for his family of nine, his ten hens, and four pigs. “When we are not going to use a glass of water we give it to our chickens, that&#8217;s enough to quench the thirst of up to two hens. We cannot waste any water, the trip to the river is very hard.”</p>
<p>Five of Yumao’s 22 families are lucky enough to have a water distribution system that uses gravity to funnel water from a stream across the mountains. But it’s not a solution that works for everyone. Many families have settled on ground that is too flat for the system to work and must follow the arduous process of water gathering done traditionally by the women and older children in the family. Because the need for water is so great, the men now often leave the crop fields to join the long walk to the river.</p>
<div id="attachment_377" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-377" class="wp-image-377 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river.png" alt="Roberto Carlos and his father going to the river" width="589" height="391" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river.png 589w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river-300x199.png 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river-272x182.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-377" class="wp-caption-text">Roberto Carlos and his father going to the Rio Grande to collect water (Credit: Eduardo Franco Berton)</p></div>
<p>Not only is water from the Rio Grande difficult to collect, but it’s also dirty and must undergo a filtering process to make it safe to drink. Residents beat leaves from the <em>caraguatá </em>(a native plant to the Great Chaco) with stones to extract a resin that is then mixed with the muddy liquid. The mixture must sit for no longer than five to ten minutes to clean the water, but avoid picking up a bitter taste. Once it’s filtered, it must be further boiled to avoid waterborne diseases. About 10% of the river mixture is mud and must be discarded.</p>
<p>Though residents are aware of the dangers of drinking contaminated water, these methods are sometimes not enough to protect the community from harmful bacteria and chemicals in their water supply. Ely Zarate, a woman of small stature but great courage and strength, is Yumao’s <em>Mburuvicha</em>, which means leader in the Guarani language. With misty eyes, she recalls when her seven children suffered from gastrointestinal and skin diseases due to the water. “I thank God my children got better,” she says. “They were very sick.”</p>
<p>According to Zarate, the river water is often tainted with insecticide runoff during the rainy season, causing the death of fish along the shore. When people enter the contaminated river, she says, they get rashes on their skin.</p>
<p>Threats to the Yumao community don’t only come from the water. In the past, Zarate says, children who have gone to help their mothers bring water home become ill with fever and severe headaches due to the intense heat of the afternoon sun. Crops, she says, are also being affected. &#8221;We have less forest that refreshes the air…where there is no forest cover it’s much hotter,” says Ely Zarate. “Our climate has changed a lot and that is affecting the water provision and our crops.”</p>
<p>And temperatures in the Great Chaco are predicted to rise. New climatic research from the Nature Friends Foundation (FAN) projects that temperatures could increase up to 1.43 °C in the Bolivian Chaco until the year 2030, this rise is predicted to occur during the wet season. This temperature is predicted to bring significant changes to the ecosystem and its natural resources, and put additional stress on the dwindling water supply.</p>
<h2><strong>Urgency in the Great Chaco</strong></h2>
<p>The Great American Chaco is the second largest forest region of Latin America after the Amazon, and the largest continuous dry forest in the world. Its diverse habitats range from swamps, lagoons and sub-humid forests in the east, to grasslands and dry forests in the west. These environments harbor a high diversity of plant and animal species, including 150 types of mammals, 500 birds, 186 amphibian species, 297 reptiles, and 3,400 plant species, of which 400 are endemic. The Chaco region spans just over one million square kilometers, with 46% located in Argentina, 34% in Paraguay, 20% in Bolivia, and a small fraction in Brazil.</p>
<p>According to the Chaco Network (a regional group made up of 15 NGOs from Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina), this large forest area is particularly important as a global carbon sink, with the potential to sequester an estimated one billion tons of carbon annually with proper sustainable land and ecosystem management. But the Great Chaco is also considered a fragile ecosystem due to the limited rainfall and high temperatures, a major blow to the population that already suffers from one of the lowest human development indices in the region.</p>
<p>In its recently released plan to reduce greenhouse gases ahead of the Paris climate summit, the Bolivian government stated that commitments from developing countries would depend on the provision of financial resources and technology transfer from their developed counterparts. According to Yumao residents, however, it’s their government that isn’t doing enough. Economic support, they say, is urgently needed in order to solve chronic water shortages they face in the region.</p>
<p>Where the Bolivian government has fallen short, other groups are stepping in to try and ease the Chaco water crisis. Recently, some families in Yumao have been benefiting from a project designed to help them harvest rainwater by the Development Area Project (PDA) organization. The system allows them to collect rain by using a tank installed on their roof that drains into a larger 5,000 liter receptacle. When the rain does fall, it provides welcome relief. A full tank of collected water—though rare—can last up to two to three months, depending on the size and needs of the family.</p>
<div id="attachment_375" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-375" class="size-full wp-image-375" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao.jpg" alt="Children of Yumao (Credit: Eduardo Franco Berton)" width="589" height="889" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao.jpg 589w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao-199x300.jpg 199w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao-530x800.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-375" class="wp-caption-text">Children of Yumao (Credit: Eduardo Franco Berton)</p></div>
<p>Residents can also get bi-monthly shipments of water, but the cost is steep. Trucks can distribute an average of 12,000 liters of water to four families at a cost of 500 bolivianos—equivalent to 71 USD—but can only come every two months because of high demand across the municipality of Gutierrez. One average, the shipments can last a family of six for up to two weeks, but the number of animals a family must provide for can greatly reduce this outlook.</p>
<p>While there is an urgent need for infrastructure investment in Yumao, the price tag is expensive. The community’s remaining 17 families who don’t have access to a water system have no choice but to make the daily trip to the river, with no guarantee that the water they are drinking is clean. A proposal to drill water wells for the irrigation of crops could reduce the amount of water needed to be carried back, but it costs an estimated $15,000, money that is not in the budget of Yumao, nor the municipality of Gutierrez.</p>
<h2><strong>Golden grain at risk</strong></h2>
<p>Corn—Yumao’s “golden grain”—is the backbone of the community’s economy and culture, but with little available water, it’s becoming more and more difficult to produce. Despite the region’s extreme conditions, farmers pride themselves on producing some of the country’s best. <em>“Chicha</em>,” a corn drink, is consumed during meals and they also used corn seeds to feed chickens, making the crop an important staple for the community. But unlike other eco regions in Bolivia where farmers can produce a harvest twice a year, in Yumao they can only grow corn once a year due to poor moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Yumao’s residents still recall when they could spend all day working in the fields. These days, the afternoon sun can reach a scorching 47 °C, making it impossible to work. Farmers get up at dawn and often have to quit by nine or ten in the morning to wait out the heat.</p>
<p>“Our economy and daily lives are devoted to agriculture, the livelihood of our families are based on the sowing and harvesting of corn<em>,</em>” says Freddy Lara, who is in charge of agricultural programs in the municipality of Gutierrez. He says that changes in the weather have also altered the corn planting season. Planting used to take place in November, but now can be as late as March because of delayed rains.</p>
<p>The long, hot days can also damage corn seeds, which increase the production costs for Yumao’s ailing farmers, who have to buy replacement seed at higher market prices. These unexpected costs can threaten the family’s ability to pay for important expenses, such as health care and education, forcing some people to leave the community in the search of work.</p>
<p>“My dream is to become a teacher when I am older, I would like to teach other children what I learn,” says Lupe Cuellar’s 10-year-old son Roberto Carlos. His hopeful eyes and charismatic smile shine under a big camouflaged hat. Under the proud gaze of his father, he recites a poem he wrote that reached the final round of a national poetry competition. Across the yard, the laughter of his brothers can be heard as they chase one another around the water tank.</p>
<p>On the horizon, the sun begins to set on the Great Chaco, snapping the intense heat for the remainder of the day. Roberto Carlos looks over at <em>Jincho</em> and the donkey begins to fidget at his post. It will soon be time to return to the river.</p>
