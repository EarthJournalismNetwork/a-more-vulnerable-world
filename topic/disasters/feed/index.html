								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixty two-year-old Luciano Mangaeao of Paranora in Beira, Mozambique could not hide his fear.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his hand on a sweltering afternoon and remarked dejectedly: “It’s almost rain season and I know what it means for us. It means a season of suffering; floods and storms are coming again.”</p>
<p>Though he has lived with his family in Paranora on the coast of the Indian Ocean for over three decades, the extreme weather events experienced in Beira over the past decade have left him and other residents at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>Beira, a colonial city that sprouted in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, was originally designed to accommodate 30,000 people, but today it is Mozambique’s second largest city with a population of more than 500,000. The city is a critical gateway to the sea for landlocked countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, but many of the residents live in abject poverty.</p>
<p>Experts say that tropical cyclones build up over the Indian Ocean and send water surging into Beira, inundating residential and poverty-stricken areas, many of which are below sea level. Within hours, the drainage system backs up, evacuation routes are cut off, and fecal material seeps into the fields and the food chain, even contaminating drinking water.</p>
<p>Figures from the Mozambican government reveal that between 1980 and 1993, two category three or higher cyclones hit the country, compared to seven in the period between 1994 and 2007.According to a 2013 report,<em>Assessing the Risk of Cyclone-Induced Storm Surge and Sea-level Rise in Mozambique</em>, wind risks in Beira are much higher than in the capital, Maputo. Maputo is more effectively shielded by the Madagascar land-mass, which also tends to dissipate cyclone energy, so the probability of intense wind events is much higher in Beira.</p>

<p>“During the rainy season some parts of Beira experience massive flooding and we are forced to abandon our homes and move to higher areas inland. We lose property worth thousands of dollars each season but because our lives depend on the sea we have no choice but to return after the floods,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>Some buildings have been abandoned for good and are left to slowly crumble. A deserted government building stands close to the sea, so are many others including shops and beer halls. Roads have been also been destroyed.</p>
<p>The crudely built stone, sack and sand sea walls tell a story of poverty as Beira struggles to adapt to climate change-induced calamities. Some of the sea barricades have succumbed to tropical cyclones and storms. Other parts of the barricades are slowly receding into the rising sea water.</p>
<p>The extreme weather events in Beira are beyond the comprehension of many, with some residents convinced that the apocalyptic end is nigh.</p>
<p>“No one is telling us what is happening but from the stories we hear on television the future does not look good for us,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>His fears were shared by Luiza Ferenando, an illiterate middle aged woman who lives in Storire, a neighborhood in the city.</p>
<p>“My life depends on fishing and I can’t leave this place. I have no other opportunities outside this area,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" class="size-large wp-image-266" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg" alt="Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-266" class="wp-caption-text">Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Thirty four-year-old Eduardo Fuinouto has been living in Paranora for sixteen years, selling different wares to the fishermen in Beira.</p>
<p>“When storms come our businesses come to a halt and we move to higher grounds. But our future is here and we hope our mayor will do something to serve our city and our businesses,” Fuinouto said.</p>
<p>Faustino Estacha, a twenty three-year-old university student, also remains optimistic that the mayor of Beirahas bigger plans to save the city.</p>
<p>“One of these plans is to build a sea wall which can save our homes,” he said.</p>
<p>He added: “People have nice homes and they can’t just leave but the barricades which used to be here have been destroyed by the sea water.”</p>
<p>According to Bill McKibben, a U.S.-based climate activist and founder of <em>350.org</em>, some communities facing rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions have no choice but to leave for good.</p>
<p>“Building sea walls is an option, but very expensive. The frustration is that the world seems not care. It’s a very depressing situation and some people (living on coastal areas) have to pack their bags and go,” McKibben said.</p>
<p>In the face of this growing threat, Graca Machel, a human rights activist and member of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders who work together for peace and human rights,urges coastal countries to develop programs to better assist these vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>“Countries on coastal areas should come up with policies on how to protect communities or encourage the people to move a little further from the coast,” Machel said.</p>
<p>The mayor of Beira, Daviz Simango, said more than 100,000 residents living in low lying areas in the city will have to be relocated to higher areas in the next decade.</p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-large wp-image-265" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>He was quick to add that the city needed more than US$100 million to address climate change-induced problems, an amount that he said the city could not raise without the intervention of the private sector.</p>
<p>A Dutch engineering firm, Deltares, is working with other private companies like Witteveen +Bos, Wissing, Niras Mozambique and VandenBroek Consulting to partner with the city of Beira to develop a so-called <em>Beira Master Plan 2035 </em>and avert a full-on climate change disaster.</p>
<p>“Two important initiatives in this respect are: capacity building and institutional strengthening focused on the planning and enforcement capacity of municipality and the establishment of the Beira Land Development Company,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Simango said the Land Development Company, which will be a partnership between the city and private investors, will assist in the implementation of a new finance model where financial feasibility of the Beira Municipality and of the masterplan is increased through several business cases.</p>
<p>“The selling of dredging sand and the selling of land with road and drainage infrastructure are important income generating elements of this finance model,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Deltares senior project manager Peter Letitre said they would establish a land development company through an initial investment of up to US$20 million.</p>
<p>“A reasonable starting budget would be around US$10- $20 million. Planning capacity and financial means need to be mobilized. Besides, a better (win-win) cooperation between City and Port of Beira is very important for the economic growth of the Port and the City”.</p>
<p>According to this ambitious plan, the city needs to stop uncontrolled issuing of land to developers especially in areas which should be designated for water retention.</p>
<p>There is also a need to plan, zone and enforce land reserved for important future infrastructure projects like retention basins, drainage canals, sewage lines and roads. Assessments of the potential vulnerabilities of vital infrastructure – such as power lines, roads and railways – to flooding, and repairs of these weaknesses must also be conducted.</p>
<p>But significant obstacles to the implementation of such plans remain.</p>
<p>Land regulations in Beira are poorly enforced, which contributes to fragmented urban development. Here, speculators purchase property at low prices with the hope of later turning a profit, and are not willing to give it to the government for infrastructure projects. Because there is no incentive for these private developers to work alongside government plans, sustainable development in Beira remains just out of reach.</p>
<div id="attachment_269" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-269" class="size-large wp-image-269" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg" alt="Communities along Beira's vulnerable coastline (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-269" class="wp-caption-text">Communities along Beira&#8217;s vulnerable coastline (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Letitre said the government must play a critical role in designating and enforcing reserved spaces for important future projects.</p>
<p>“This is a complex process for which cooperation of the inhabitants is very important. Ordinary people (in Beira) are also involved in planning of various projects such as the drainage projects in various neighborhoods, in cooperation with the authorities. They are also involved in operation and maintenance of drainage projects and solid waste projects,” Letitre said.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, Letitre remains bullish on Beira’s future. “After the master plan is successfully implemented,” he said, “Beira will be a safer, more sustainable, prosperous and beautiful city.”</p>
<p>These are hopeful words, but one thing is certain: successful implementation of the Beira Master Plan will require the participation of key stakeholders in the city or risk facing the same fate as similar plans that have come before it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For all his life, 60-year-old Abdul Rehman Dar had proudly tilled the land on his three-acre farm in the highly productive Kashmir Valley. But his work came to a sudden halt when the surging Vishu River flattened two-thirds of his village and damaged hundreds of acres of prized agricultural land in September 2014.</p>
<p>Like many others who lost nearly everything in Gund village, which lies in the southern district of Kulgam, Dar’s self-confidence has taken a beating. “All my land is under layers of mud, sand and boulders deposited by that ruthless flood,” he says, barely able to hold back tears. In a sobbing voice, he says that the loss of his farmland has shattered all his dreams.</p>
<p>After years of hard work in the fields, Dar had planned to pass the farm to his son. The region is known for its agriculture and farming was a reliable source of income that his family could rely on. Now the future is less clear.</p>
<div id="attachment_451" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-451" class="size-large wp-image-451" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-1024x681.jpg" alt="Farmer Abdul Rehman Dar has found it hard to recover from the loss of his land and house. Doctors have diagnosed him with depression.

Doctors have diagnosed him with depression. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>“Losing my prized land is simply the end of my life and the beginning of hardships for my family,” Dar says. “Some years back I refused to accept a job offer for my only son in the police department with the hope that he has a lot to thrive on in the form of my three-acre farm land. But, today I strongly regret that decision.” The guilt, he says, still haunts him, but police work is a dangerous job in a place like Kashmir where squads encounter pro-freedom protesters fighting to end Indian rule on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Though it’s been over a year since the floodwaters devastated his village, Dar still lives in a make-shift single room that was hastily provided by the government to house more than 50 displaced families. Lying in his bed, he spends a lot of time worrying about his family’s prospects. “Now what can my son do? He is not capable of working as a daily laborer, but then, he has no other option,” Dar says. “He has to earn for the survival of his family – his wife and two small kids.”</p>
<p>Job opportunities in the Kashmir Valley are slim. With little industry, most vacancies are offered by the government through its police and education departments. Recent years have seen massive corruption as desperate families often pay bribes to ensure slots for their sons and daughters on employment lists.</p>
<p>Dar says he could have easily bought that officer job for his son by bribing the fixer who offered the position. Now even these jobs are becoming scarce. “Today my son would have had the support of a steady monthly salary. But, while nature snatched away the land from him, I deprived him off a job,” he says regretfully.</p>
<p>Many farmers like Dar who are in similar positions have little to fall back on. According to official figures, around 135,000 hectares of agricultural land has suffered damage due to flooding over the last year in more than 100 villages in Kashmir. In many rural areas, surging waters from the tributaries of Jhelum washed away stretches of land where paddy, maize and orchards once stood.</p>
<div id="attachment_458" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-458" class="size-large wp-image-458" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-1024x681.jpg" alt="Two-third of the Gund village in south Kashmir has been wiped out by September 2014 floods (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)" width="760" height="505" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-1020x678.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-458" class="wp-caption-text">Two-thirds of the Gund village in south Kashmir was wiped out by September 2014 floods (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>Shahbaz Lone, a farmer in Sonawari-Bandipore, lost a year’s worth of crops and much of his land to the September floods, but he has yet to receive substantial assistance from the government, save a 200kg bag of rice. It has been difficult, he says, to find work as a day laborer and he had to sell off his herd of seven cattle because he could no longer afford to feed them.</p>
<p><strong>The Psychological Impact </strong></p>
<p>As the initial shock of devastation and loss wears off, those struggling to recover from extreme weather events with little help are facing long-term psychological impacts. Dar shows symptoms of depression and anxiety, and complains of many health issues. His son, Altaf Ahmad, has taken him to various doctors, but nothing so far has worked. “Most of the times he stays quiet and sometimes he breaks down all of a sudden,” Ahmad says. It’s becoming a common problem in the community as many flood victims waiting for assistance are losing hope.</p>
<p>Ahmad says that in addition to his father, other members of his family worry about how they will be able to build a new home without any resources coming in. So far, the family says it has received no substantial help from the government.</p>
<p>“The government had assured us of financial assistance for constructing our new homes, but we have only received 75,000 rupees ($1,175 USD), which is peanuts. And we don’t even have land where we can construct our houses. It won’t be free of danger to construct them again in our previous village which was ruined by the floods,” Ahmad says.</p>
<p>According to the latest official numbers—which many locals believe are purposefully understated— the floods destroyed 67,661 homes and affected the livelihoods of 30,000 people. During a recent visit to the region, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged 2,000 crore Indian rupees (approximately $303 million USD), but this falls far short of the estimated 44,000 crore rupees ($6.02 billion USD) requested shortly after the floods to reconstruct damaged infrastructure and compensate for losses suffered by the flood-hit families.</p>

<p>With little available help from the government, affected residents are struggling to find ways to restart their lives. Helplessness gives way to frustration, as many are unable to leave the makeshift accommodation they’ve been living in since the floods hit last September. With all members of the family occupying a single room, there is no privacy and schoolchildren lack separate rooms to study in. The aftermath of the floods, they say, has impacted all parts of their lives.</p>
<p>“A youth, who was engaged to a girl in a nearby village, was forced to break his relationship as the parents of his fiancée were not sure about his prospects,” a flood victim who preferred to stay anonymous said while referring to the challenges they have been confronting.</p>
<p>Concerns over livelihood and survival are starting to take their toll on the mental health of the community. Dr. Arshad Hussain, a psychiatrist in Srinagar, says that while this is a normal reaction for people whose lives are uprooted by a sudden disaster, it’s not surprising that effects are more strongly felt in Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Kashmir is already witness to one of the worst conflicts of modern times with huge human costs and a heavy toll on mental health,” he says. “Lifetime prevalence of major depression, substance use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is at all-time high in this part of the world.” If important steps such as psychological counseling and financial support to victims are delayed or not taken, Hussain says the problem can get much worse. “The economic costs of this huge mental health burden can be enormous,” he says. “The more we delay rehabilitation, more and more of them will succumb to depression. Such a scenario has to be avoided at all costs.”</p>
<p>Psychologist Roshan Ara, who has carried out research on the mental health of disaster victims, says that continuous engagement is necessary until key issues are addressed. “Soon after the floods, many non-governmental organizations started taking care of the mental health of the victims. Some of them had made arrangements for recreational activities for children in the cold season, but such an engagement should have been continued for some more time,” Ara says.</p>
<p><strong>Deepening hardships</strong></p>
<p>Trade is the predominant source of economic activity in Srinagar City, but thousands of small businesses were destroyed by the recent flood. Rafiq Rather used to support his family by selling clothes in Batmaloo, but his business, which was heavily damaged by the floodwaters, was not insured. “After the flood, I took the cloth rolls out of the shop and cleaned them for many days with the help of my wife and kids,” he says, “But, I still couldn’t get one-third of the money I had gotten them for.”</p>
<p>It’s a major economic blow. To make ends meet, Rather now sells clothes from a cart on the street. “Life has become really hard after the floods. I wonder for how long I can carry on,” he says.</p>

<p>Rather is not alone. According to the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation (KTMF), over 33,000 businesses suffered losses during the September 2014 floods. A majority of them were not insured against losses due to natural disasters.</p>
<p>The Jammu and Kashmir government made assurances that businesses who had suffered losses would be given financial support, but many are still waiting. “Only around 600 shopkeepers and other businessmen among 33,000 have got the financial assistance. The rest are yet to get it,” KTMF said during a recent statement.</p>
<p>Another group, the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), has questioned the manner and pace of rehabilitation process for the flood victims. “It’s ironic that only Rs 2,000 crore rupees ($303 million USD) is earmarked for rehabilitation of flood victims and out of this, only Rs 800 crore rupees ($120 million USD) are for the rehabilitation of businesses,” says KCCI’s president, Mushtaq Ahmad Wani.</p>
<p>“The government has clearly failed to meet the expectations of the flood victims in general and the small businessmen in particular. Even insurance companies have settled claims of over 2,000 crore rupees.”</p>
<p><strong>Artisans affected</strong></p>
<p>Kashmir handicrafts such as Pashima shawls, are world famous and have long been a major source of economic income, but these prized artisans were among the worst hit. Many beautiful products and studios were damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Without tools or material, local artisan Bashir Mir cannot work. “These days, I am as good as a fish out of water,” he says. “I used to get advance money and raw material from a trader for weaving the shawls. But ever since he heard that floods had washed away my tools and my house, he never met me for work.”</p>
<p>Like many of his fellow artisans, Mir—once highly sought after for his products—is now seeking employment as an unskilled laborer. Not only does he make less, but opportunities have also gone cold with the onset of winter.</p>
<div id="attachment_463" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-463" class="size-large wp-image-463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1024x681.jpg" alt="Women wash dishes outside their make-shift shelters (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)" width="760" height="505" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1020x678.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-463" class="wp-caption-text">Women wash dishes outside their make-shift shelters (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>“During the past week, I could work for two days only,” he says. In north Kashmir, an NGO has set up Artisan Production and Development Centers (APDCs) to aid unemployed workers, but artisans in Mir’s area have received no such support.</p>
<p>“Apart from the loss or damage in terms of products and tools, the artisan community was confronted with extreme financial hardships because they used to get advance wages,” says Yasir Qureshi, Senior Program Manager for  the Indo-Global Social Service Society (IGSSS). “We have set up 13 such centers and are also providing material support to the artisans for weaving of carpets. Entire amount earned by selling the product goes to the artisans.”</p>
<p>A year on, thousands of farmers, traders and skilled laborers are still waiting for the government to come out with a comprehensive plan to revive their shattered economy. In the meantime, communities are attempting to move forward. Taxi driver Bilal Ahmad Koka, who lost both of his cabs to the floods, says he was lucky they were insured. “Otherwise, today I would be also one of those wanting the government to do something for me,” Koka says. One beneficiary of the recent disasters, local insurance companies claim to have seen a 500 percent increase in new policies. “Following the floods, businessmen are insuring businesses against full value and are quite willing to pay high premiums,” says Imtiyaz Ahmad, who works for an Indian insurance company in Kashmir. But tougher regulations on agricultural businesses are preventing farmers from</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first drops of rain drew the children out of their houses. As the first rainfall to come to Wadi el Lega, a tiny desert settlement in South Sinai, in more than six months, this was cause to celebrate. Rain brought green shrubs for their camels and goats to eat; rain refilled their cisterns; rain signaled an end to the fierce summer heat.</p>
<p>The children raced and shrieked as the rain fell harder and harder. Inside their brick houses, the parents smiled and thanked God. It was only October; such a rare early rain promised a good, wet winter. About thirty minutes went by. Then quite suddenly, the shrieks outside turned to screams.</p>
<p>“Someone began yelling that three children had been swept away by the water,” recalls Hussein, a member of the Mzeina Bedouin tribe settled in South Sinai. “The water was like a sea. It carried the children away. They found two of them, but there was one little girl they couldn’t find. They later found her when the rain stopped. She had drowned.”</p>

<p>Flash flooding has always been a danger in the valleys at the base of the Sinai Mountains. The hard, dry ground can become saturated in an instant, allowing torrents of water to rush down the mountain like a waterslide, wiping away stretches of road and <a href="https://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/01/19/97770.html">razing whole villages</a>. But historically, such floods were few and far between. It’s only in the last few years that things have started to change. The Sinai has now been hit by a series of fierce, unexpected, and unprecedented floods, and its people are struggling to protect themselves from the torrents.</p>
<p>“Ten years ago, we had rain maybe once a year,” says Haj Jabali, a 65-year old resident of St. Katherine, a town in the mountains above Wadi el Lega. “These last few years, it’s been far colder and we’ve had a lot more rain. The rain for us up here, it’s a good thing … But the rain can get up to one or two meters high down in the valley, like a sea.” In a country with an annual average rainfall of <a href="http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=country_historical_climate&amp;ThisRegion=Africa&amp;ThisCCode=EGY">41.4 mm</a>, such fierce rainstorms have caught the people and their government off guard. As it is right now, Egypt simply does not have the infrastructure to cope with these increasingly frequent floods.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>About 20 minutes’ drive from St. Katherine<strong>, </strong>down in the valley called Sebaia, Haj Ibrahim has built a dirt mound wall about half a meter high around the periphery of his family’s settlement in an effort to keep the water from rushing into their houses. “Normally, the rain falls into the ravine and its OK,” Ibrahim says. “But if it comes down really strong like it has the last few years, then it overflows out of the ravine and then it can become dangerous. It can flood into people’s houses.”</p>

<p><span class="ng-scope">As residents struggle to adapt to the rainstorms, simple retaining walls like Ibrahim&#8217;s have become common sights in the wadis, or valleys, of South Sinai. Tribal elders such as Jabali see these rainstorms as flukes—an odd interruption in their seasonal routine that will soon pass. </span> And that’s entirely possible, says Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Meteorologists have been hesitant to definitively attribute short-term changes in precipitation patterns to the long-term effects of man-made climate change. <span class="ng-scope">However, a <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-scientists-find-precipitation-global-warming-link" target="_blank">2013 study</a> by scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory showed that natural variability can&#8217;t account for all the observed changes in global precipitation. It would seem, then, that global climate change is certainly a culprit behind this uptick in extreme rainstorms.</span></p>
<p>“In such storms, the air is nearly completely saturated. And in warmer climates, that saturation level increases as it gets warmer,” Wehner says. “Hence, many individual storms have been formally attributed […] to the human induced global warming.” If these storms in the Sinai are indeed products of global climate change, then the data shows they won’t be going anywhere; rather, they could become the norm.</p>
<p>For Mohamed el Raey, a professor of environmental studies at Alexandria University, there is little doubt: these storms are a direct result of global temperature rise and Egypt is fated to see more of them. “An increase in temperatures will lead to an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events,” says el Raey. “To put it as simply as I can, the histogram of temperatures is shifting, making it more likely for extreme events to occur.” To put it <a href="http://co2now.org/Know-the-Changing-Climate/Climate-Changes/ipcc-faq-changes-in-precipitation.html">even more simply</a>, as the planet warms, water on the surface of lakes and oceans evaporates more quickly. At the same time, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it is able to retain. This means that warm places such as Egypt go longer without rain, as evaporated water accumulates in the atmosphere—and then when it does finally rain, it pours.</p>

<p>el Raey wrote as much in a <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227086576_Climatic_drivers_of_potential_hazards_in_Mediterranean_coasts._Reg_Environ_Chang">2010 paper</a> in the journal of Regional Environmental Change, where he looked at the effects of climate change in the Mediterranean basin. “Global climate model simulations indicate that there shall be a decrease in yearly average [rainfall] values but that the return period for heavy rainfall events may decrease…. This … should lead to an intensification of flooding during the rainy period.”</p>
<p>So far, el Raey has found his predictions to be ominously accurate. “These extreme weather events started to show up in December 2010, and they’ve become more and more common,” he says. Despite decades of warnings by el Raey and others in the academic community, the more immediate problems of political instability and economic malaise have taken precedence over the projected danger of climate change. As a result, Egypt now finds itself largely unprepared for this onslaught of severe storms—and the sparsely populated, economically marginalized Sinai region is the least of the state’s worries.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>In October, President Abdel Fattah el Sisi found himself facing rare and stinging criticism <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/10/25/prime-minister-heads-to-alexandria-to-assess-damages-from-flooding/">rains inundated</a> Egypt’s second city of Alexandria, <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/26/climate-change-to-increase-alexandria-flooding.html">killing six</a> and forcing schools, businesses, and government offices to shutter for days. Dramatic photos of buses floating in five feet of water were plastered all over the front pages of the national newspapers. The governor of Alexandria was forced to resign for failing to prevent the disaster. But in reality, the city’s problems began long before the recently-elected governor came to power.</p>
<p>“Entire parts of the city have been built below sea level, but people don’t realize this,” el Raey explains. “The water collects in these areas and floods the entire first floor of some buildings.”</p>
<p>Alexandria’s other main problem is that it grew far too fast for its sewage and drainage infrastructure. The city used to have two sets of underground canals: one that drained rainwater back into the sea, and one that directed sewage water toward a treatment plant. But by 1987, with the city’s sewage system overflowing, the government opted to turn the rainwater canals into extra sewage canals, .</p>
<p>This was only ever intended to be a short-term fix, but today the city still operates without a rainwater drainage system. This wasn’t a major issue when Alexandria was receiving <a href="http://www.alexandria.climatemps.com">7.4 inches</a> of rain per year. But when hit with 10 inches of rain over a two-day span, as was the case in October, the city will all but sink.</p>
<p>“The government of Alexandria was not really aware of this problem, they were not prepared,” el Raey says. “There must be proactive planning.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Global leaders meeting in Paris for the <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/COP21-FAQs.pdf" target="_blank">COP21</a> Climate Change Summit are expected to draft new international regulations on greenhouse gases. But even if leaders do succeed in limiting future global warming, the current precipitation trends are likely to continue, Wehner says.</p>

<p class="ng-scope">&#8220;This means we can expect to see less normal rainfall, more droughts, and more extreme events,&#8221; el Raey adds.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Densely populated industrial cities like Alexandria can probably expect some hustle from their government to mitigate the effects of these changing weather patterns. Sisi, for his part, has already allocated $130 million to revamp Alexandria&#8217;s sewage system.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">But tiny settlements such as Wadi el Lega and Sebaia, far outside Cairo&#8217;s field of vision, are easily forgotten—and easily swept away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As winter tightens its grip over Pakistan’s Kalash valleys, home to the ancient Kalash tribe, many parts of the mountain region are still struggling to repair the damage wrought by the floods this monsoon</em></p>
<p>“You won’t recognize Bumburet Valley when we get there,” my driver informed me as we navigated through streams and attempted to cross broken roads that were washed away by the devastating floods that hit Chitral District in July and August of this year. One now needs a four-wheel drive to reach the Kalash Valleys – a harrowing 2 hour drive from Chitral town, which sits along the border with the Afghan province of Nuristan.</p>
<div id="attachment_164" style="width: 851px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164" class=" wp-image-164" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges.jpg" alt="A bridge destroyed by recent flood waters (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan) Flood waters destroyed bridges and access to the valleys (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="841" height="631" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges.jpg 960w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-164" class="wp-caption-text">A bridge destroyed by recent floodwaters (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>The three Kalash valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir are encircled by high mountains, a natural barrier from Nuristan whose people were converted to Islam in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by an Afghan king. The Kalasha are an ancient tribe, the last survivors of Kafiristan (of which Nuristan was once a part), and their pre-Islamic religion is focused on their environment: although they worship a creator called “Desau”, they also believe that trees, stones and streams all have souls.</p>
<p>A narrow road used to lead into Bumburet, the largest of the three valleys. Only recently re-opened, it’s now strewn with large boulders brought down by the floodwaters. Vehicles must cut through agricultural fields and crisscross the main <em>nullah</em> – or riverbed – just to get to its villages. Near the valley’s entrance, we passed a badly damaged government primary school. Here children must study in tents along the side of the road.</p>
<p>The nearby Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation Motel is also in ruins. A gushing stream that used the surround the property turned into a surging river as floodwaters came rushing down the mountains and into the Bumburet valley, destroying its wooden chalets and large garden.</p>
<p>The rest of the valley’s main town was also badly hit. Once a popular tourist destination, the big hotels all suffered major damage, as did countless shops, around two dozen houses, many orchards, fields and of course the main road itself.</p>

<p>“I would say the floods were a result of all the deforestation that has taken place in these valleys in recent years, just look at the bare mountain sides – and of course climate change was also responsible. It is almost the end of September now and it is still warm; in earlier years the summer would end in August when we would celebrate our autumn festival,” explains Akram Hussain, a Kalash man who is in charge of the Kalasha Cultural Centre built by the Greek government in 2004, which is thankfully still intact.</p>
<p>The Centre houses an impressive museum, community center and educational facilities for the Kalash people. In the museum, one can find a large collection of Kalasha antiques like old jewelry, cooking utensils, sculptures of horses, rugs and costumes. The Kalasha women still wear their traditional dress, an embroidered black frock tied at the waist by a belt or sash.</p>
<p>Strong stone walls built around the Centre by Greek volunteers ultimately saved it from the forceful impact of the floods. “The high walls withstood the floodwaters, which came rushing down from the mountains at one end of the valley and went around the building,” says Hussain. Sadly, it’s likely to be the last bit of sizeable aid the Kalasha will receive from the Greek government, which continues to pay for teachers and school supplies at the Cultural Centre, but is now facing severe economic problems at home.</p>
<p>The Greeks believe that the Kalasha are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army, which marched through the Hindu Kush Mountains centuries ago. Indeed, last year a team of geneticists led by Oxford University sampled genomes from around the world and found that the Kalash people of Pakistan have chunks of DNA from an ancient European population.</p>

<p>Today, only 4,114 Kalasha remain according to a census conducted in July 2014, but there have been many conversions to Islam as more outsiders settle into the Kalash Valleys, often building homes near the main road. Around 1,800 Kalasha live in Bumburet, but higher up along the sides of the valley.</p>
<p>“Our culture was already under threat, and now these floods have destroyed our crops and orchards. We will have to buy food from the bazaar and store it if we are to survive this winter. Luckily, there was no loss of lives in Bumburet because we got a call from the border police which jointly patrols the border with the army. They called us over our mobile phones to warn us that the flood was coming,” says Hussain. “I called people living near the Bumburet <em>nullah</em> (the mountain stream that runs through the valley floor) and told them to get out.”</p>
<p>Hussain tells us there were two major floods in Bumburet in July and a smaller one in August. “The second flood in July that lasted for two days caused the most damage. We have never seen floods like this in the Kalash valleys before. I would say that at least half of Bumburet Valley was destroyed or damaged by these floods.”</p>
<p>Despite the widespread destruction, only four of the 22 houses swept away belonged to Kalash families. “Our houses are mostly built higher up and all the people living below ran up to our homes,” explains Shaheen Gul, a young Kalash woman living in Krakal Village in Bumburet. “But our fields with corn and beans that were ready for harvest and fruit trees like walnuts and apricots are gone as they were near the <em>nullah</em>.”</p>
<p>Krakal Village is one of the oldest settlements in Bumburet, built high above the main road. While the Kalasha’s traditional wooden homes are well-built and extremely tough, Gul says it was a terrifying night for all involved. “We could hear the flood before it arrived – we were so scared by the roaring sound in the middle of the night. Then the earth started shaking as if there was an earthquake. It was raining very hard that night,” she recalls. “Later when we came down we saw all the destruction – these floods were definitely much worse than the 2010 floods.”</p>

<p>The soldiers patrolling the border with Afghanistan say that melting glaciers also played a role in the recent floods. “There are around four glaciers high up above in these mountains overlooking Bumburet,” explains Shair Shah, a member of the Chitral Levies border force. “Glacial floods came down along with the rain water, that is why there were so many large boulders and we even saw large chunks of black ice.”</p>
<p>Syed Harir Shah, a disaster risk reduction expert from Chitral, feels that torrential rainfall was the main cause of the flooding, “The shifting of the monsoon further west to Chitral is a highly unusual event,” he says. “It needs to be researched. How did it shift? Why was no proper warning given to the people of Chitral?”</p>
<p>National climate change expert Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry blames the erratic monsoon weather this year on El Niño, a periodic warming of the ocean along the equatorial Pacific that impacts weather patterns. “[El Niño] contributed to the abruptness of the monsoon this summer. Some monsoon currents penetrated into the Hindu Kush mountain range, an area which generally lies outside the monsoon belt,” says the former head of Pakistan’s Meteorological Department. “The persistent rainfall accelerated snow melting and triggered both floods and the outbursts of glacial lakes.”</p>
<p>His explanation reflects what eyewitnesses in Rumbur Valley – the second area to be badly affected by the flooding – have reported. The third Kalash valley of Birir was not damaged by the floodwaters.</p>
<p>“The floods started on the 13<sup>th</sup> of July and we had almost continuous flooding until the 5<sup>th</sup> of August. We had rainfall almost every day. There were two types of floods – one was a glacier flood in the Rumbur <em>Nullah</em> and the other was flash floods coming down one of the mountain sides,” says Mohammed Iqbal, a Kalash social worker with the Pakistan Red Crescent Society. “The water flooded into the Jestak temple (dedicated to the deity that protects family) in Balanguru village, but luckily it was not badly damaged.”</p>
<p>According to Iqbal, a survey of the valley found that around 34 houses in Rumbur were damaged or destroyed by the floods, but an early mobile alert from shepherds high up in the mountains prevented any loss of life in the valley. “The shepherds told us that they saw cloudbursts over the Gangalurat glacier on the boundary with Nuristan which then burst,” he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="size-full wp-image-159" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg" alt="Damaged homes near the river (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg 960w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Damaged homes near the river (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>The floods brought down boulders, trees and whatever else was in their way, destroying orchards, fields, water channels and roads. Today the road to Rumbur Valley – an hour’s drive from the larger Bumburet Valley – is barely open. At a certain point, one must travel by foot to the villages beyond a bridge that has miraculously survived.</p>
<p>“I think there were around 40 to 50 floods here this summer – in 2010 (a year of widespread flooding throughout Pakistan) there was just one big flood,” explains Iqbal as we walk a path to the valley that eventually disappears, having been swept away by the flood in the <em>nullah</em>.</p>
<p>The Kalash people living higher up in the Rumbur Valley have to literally cling to the cliff wall above the <em>nullah. </em>Precarious wooden planks wedged into the mountainside provide a rickety path to the main village where shops are located. There are no big hotels here, just a few guesthouses where tourists can stay overnight. Locals say the re-opening of the road to the valley in late September brought an end to a worsening food crisis, at least for now.</p>
<p>“We were confined to the houses located further up on the mountain sides and we ran out of food,” recalls Iqbal. “We had to rely on the army helicopters who dropped wheat and other rations during the floods.” Luckily, their mobile phones were still working so they could alert the outside world.</p>
<div id="attachment_166" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166" class="size-large wp-image-166" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach-1024x768.jpg" alt="Traditional Kalash homes are built high up on the sides of the mountain (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-166" class="wp-caption-text">Traditional Kalash homes are built high up on the sides of the mountain (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>“The noise of the floods was deafening. The children are still so traumatized. Every time it rains now they start crying and saying ‘a flood is coming,’” says Naseem, a Kalash woman who lives in Grum Village at the entrance to the Rumbur Valley. She says with winter approaching they will be facing some hard times.</p>
<p>“All our crops with potatoes, beans and sorghum near the <em>nullah</em> are gone along with so many fruit trees,” she says. “The drinking water supply has not been restored and the women have to go down to the <em>nullah</em> daily to fetch water and carry it up in large vessels. The children and elderly are starting to get waterborne diseases and falling sick. The electricity has not been restored either.” A micro-hydro plant used to provide electricity to Rumbur Valley, but was damaged by the floods. The community plans to fix it before winter. The main water pipeline was also damaged and the local people are urging the government to restore it.</p>
<p>“For now the people who lost their homes are living with relatives, but that will put a strain on everyone over the long winter months when the valley is cut off by snow and we can’t buy supplies from the outside. In November, the snow starts to fall and roads are closed for almost four months,” says Quaid-e-Azam, a Kalash man who works for a hotel in Chitral town. “However, I have heard that the World Food Programme is planning to give food to the Kalash Valleys for the four winter months.”</p>
<p>Despite the obvious hardships, the Kalasha people remain quite resilient. They even celebrated their annual Uchaw Festival in late August. “Uchaw commemorates the harvest,” explains Azam, “and we celebrated it…despite all the destruction. This is a religious festival and we have to continue with our culture and rituals.”</p>
<p>But he worries about the future. “The floods are becoming worse each year…we have to plan now for future floods. Today because of the growing population in the Kalash valleys people have no choice but to build near the <em>nullah,</em> but they are risking their lives. They only got saved this time because of the mobile phone warning. They were extremely lucky.”</p>
<div id="attachment_155" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Old-Kalash-woman-who-says-she-has-never-seen-such-floods-in-her-lifetime.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155" class=" wp-image-155" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Old-Kalash-woman-who-says-she-has-never-seen-such-floods-in-her-lifetime-768x1024.jpg" alt="An elderly Kalash woman said she had never seen such floods in her lifetime (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="637" height="849" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Old-Kalash-woman-who-says-she-has-never-seen-such-floods-in-her-lifetime-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Old-Kalash-woman-who-says-she-has-never-seen-such-floods-in-her-lifetime-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-155" class="wp-caption-text">An elderly Kalash woman said she had never seen such floods in her lifetime (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>Some Kalash villagers fear their deities are angry with them for the widespread environmental damage that has taken place in their ancestral homeland. “We feel the floods are coming as they are cursing us people for all this deforestation and destruction of their habitat,” says Zarin Khan, a Kalash man who works for the government’s Tourism Corporation in Chitral town. “Trees and entire forests have been cut down for both construction and firewood purposes, the animals living up in the mountains have no pine nuts to eat and even the birds go hungry.”</p>
<p>During the Uchaw festival, Kalash elders prayed to the creator Desau to save the people from future floods. But according to Azam, the torrential rainfall was so severe that the flooding even affected parts of Chitral where little deforestation is taking place. &#8220;The floods occurred in places like Reshun and Brepp were there are historically no forests. No one is safe now with all this climate change,” he says from behind the reception desk at the hotel he works at in Chitral town. &#8220;I&#8217;m very worried, the next few years are going to be very hard for us. We can only hope to survive with better planning.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahmed Rizq watched the mercury on his thermometer rise: 48, 53…55 degrees Celsius. It rose higher than he had ever seen it rise before. And then it stayed there—for over three weeks. Rizq had lived in Aswan in the very south of Egypt his whole life; he could take a little heat. But August 2015 was a new kind of hot. It was the sort of hot that could kill you.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health began distributing flyers to hospitals all around the country, encouraging citizens to stay at home if possible and avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. But those flyers never reached the desert village of Ladid, and even if they had, they wouldn’t have made a difference, said Rizq, who researches public health access for the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights. “The village is close to a mountain in the desert,” Rizq described. “There isn’t a water source inside, you’re outside the agricultural area by some kilometers.”</p>
<div id="attachment_16" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16" class="size-large wp-image-16" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Near the Sudan border, Aswan endures some of the highest temperatures in Egypt.

<p>Ladid, like most small Egyptian villages, is served by a modest medical center. In general, these centers are well equipped but lack the staff to run them, Rizq said, because anyone who can get enough medical experience to get out of his village usually does. The closest hospital is in Edfu, about an hour and a half away by public transport. By mid-August, Ladid residents were shuttling their sick and dying to and from Edfu, Luxor and Aswan general hospitals. “They were taking people one after the other to the hospital,” Rizq said. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.”</p>
<p>Ladid was hardly the only village to be overwhelmed by the crushing heat. As August crept along and the heatwave persisted, the city hospitals became overrun as patients poured in from surrounding rural villages. Heat stroke, dehydration, high blood pressure, heart attacks: the cases kept on coming and the hospitals soon ran out of beds. The <a href="https://www.google.com.eg/maps/place/Luxor+International+Hospital/@25.6872365,32.6401085,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x582cf806bf20672?sa=X&amp;ved=0CHIQ_BIwDWoVChMI9Kf4kP7byAIVSg8aCh3uLgNH">Luxor International Hospital,</a> widely considered to be the best hospital south of Assiut, was overflowing.</p>
<p>“The emergency wing can treat up to 300 patients at a time, 50 at a time in the ICU,” said an emergency room doctor who asked not to be named, as he had been instructed not to speak to the press about the heatwave. “We were always full. People had to wait.”</p>
<p>The death toll began to rise. By the second week of August, <a href="http://www.vetogate.com/1768105">13 Ladid residents had died</a>, according to local journalist Doaa Ibrahim. “They would take them to the local medical center and then to the hospital in Edfu and they would die there or on the way,” Ibrahim said. “But the government didn’t count these as heat-related deaths. They said they died of high blood pressure or liver problems or heart problems.”</p>
<p>And so when the Ministry of Health announced the official tally of heatwave casualties later that week, Ladid’s dead were not counted among them. As it stands, the official death toll for entire country stopped at <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/08/22/ministry-of-health-denies-meningitis-outbreak-in-luxor-following-deaths/">110 this summer</a>, with a mere <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/138650/Egypt/Politics-/Four-die-in-Egypts-Aswan-due-to-continued-heatwave.aspx">11 casualties</a> from Aswan, but dozens, if not hundreds more have gone unaccounted for, Rizq said. “They say [the Ladid villagers] died of natural causes, but how can you tell me 13 people from the same place died in one week from natural causes?” Rizq said.</p>
<div id="attachment_27" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27" class="size-large wp-image-27" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ahmed Rizq, an Egyptian public health researcher and lawyer, told Al Monitor that there were at least 50 heat-related deaths in the Aswan governorate alone this past summer. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.” (Credit: Nicholas Linn)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-27" class="wp-caption-text">Ahmed Rizq, an Egyptian public health researcher and lawyer, told Al Monitor that there were at least 50 heat-related deaths in the Aswan governorate alone this past summer. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.” (Credit: Nicholas Linn)</p></div>
<p>The emergency room doctor at the Luxor International Hospital confirmed that plenty of heatstroke cases went undocumented. “Officially, we maybe had 5 diagnosed cases a day of heatstroke, but we certainly saw a noticeable rise in heat deaths this summer, even if not all were documented,” he said. “Each doctor has to make his own diagnosis. One could write ‘heat stroke’ and the other could write ‘acute renal failure’ and he wouldn’t necessarily be wrong.”</p>
<p>When Al Monitor asked the hospital deputy director Nahed Ahmed Mohammed for the official number of heatstroke patients and casualties from this summer, he declined to comment.</p>
<p>“All I know is what we observe, and that’s that when the temperature goes up, the number of deaths goes up,” said Aswan resident Khaled Sadek, “We don’t have conclusive proof that the heat was what caused the death. And so that’s what you see in the government studies. Hospitals, when they get cases like these, have a lot of causes they can pick from. But that’s not actually helpful for researching the problem and understanding what’s going on here.”</p>
<p>What’s going on here, in a nutshell, is that Aswan, along with the rest of Egypt is getting hotter with every passing year. As of 2010, <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/ccl16/teco/documents/ppt/TECO-Presentations-PDF/01-7-2014/Session6/1500-1520/4-Presentation1for_conf_1jul.pdf">data from the Egyptian Meteorological Authority</a> showed that Egypt’s five hottest years in recorded history have occurred from the year 2002 onward. The data also showed that heatwaves are becoming more common and prolonged. From 2001 to 2010, Aswan recorded over 100 days with temperatures in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher—whereas in the 70s, that number was closer to 40, the study showed.</p>
<p>And as this past summer revealed, the heat is starting to take its toll. Rizq estimated that there were no fewer than 50 deaths in the Aswan governorate alone—but these casualties are just the tip of the iceberg. Bahaa George, an obstetrician at the more modest Luxor General Hospital, said the heat is proving damaging to unborn children and their mothers.</p>
<p>“When you are pregnant, you are particularly at risk of dehydration,” George said. “It can severely affect the amniotic fluid. If the mother is dehydrated, she will draw her amniotic fluid from her urine. There will also be comparatively less blood flow to the fetus and the baby’s immunity will be lower.”</p>
<p>While George said it was too soon for him to have noticed any trends in maternal or infant mortality as a result, he did say the heat was negatively affecting his patients and could cause further problems down the road.</p>
<p>For several years after they’re born, children remain particularly at risk of heat stroke and dehydration and parents are encouraged to keep them at home if temperatures climb to over 40 degrees. This will have a profound effect on elementary education rates, Sadek said. “A child can’t go out and play in the streets, he can’t go to school. And when he does go to school, he doesn’t learn anything. Most schools here don’t even have a fan,” Sadek said.</p>

<p>Additionally, rising temperatures risk leading to an increase in parasitical diseases, according to Wael Lotfy, a professor of parasitology at the faculty of Medical Research in Alexandria University. What worries him most is the possibility that in the next three or four decades, malaria could be reintroduced to Egypt if malaria-carrying mosquitoes begin to migrate north from Sudan.</p>
<p>“With global warming it is possible that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/"><em>Anapholese gambiae</em></a> [a malaria carrying mosquito] expands its range of distribution to Egypt, and hence introduces the parasite to the country,” Lotfy said. The mosquito has already been reported in Aswan and Toshka, though it was not carrying malaria.</p>
<p>In addition to malaria, Egypt could see a resurgence of <a href="http://www.who.int/schistosomiasis/en/"><em>schistosomiasis</em></a>, a disease caused by tiny worms burrowing their way through the human vascular system, harming the liver, bladder and blood vessels. The worms are carried by a particular variety of snail that thrives in warm, stagnant water. As the flow of water through the Nile and its canals lessens, Lotfy expects to see an increase in these snails, accompanied by an increase in <em>schistosomiasis</em> cases. Now more than ever, the Ministry of Health needs to ensure the accurate reporting of parasitical diseases and monitor their spread, Lotfy said. Other than that though, there isn’t much anyone can do but wait and see.</p>
<p>That’s what’s hardest for Sedky: to know the future of his homeland is out of his hands.</p>
<p>“Most of these poor people aren’t part of the problem: they use simple tools that don’t hurt the environment. But then the end result is a lot of problems that fall on them,” Sedky said. “I don’t want to live in a skyscraper. I just want to live on an island with water around me and clean environment beneath me. You can live in a skyscraper if you want but don’t you choose something that’s going to hurt me in the end. Live the way you want to live but don’t live in such a way that will hurt me here.”</p>

<p>Seventeen-year-old Virginia Pushaina drops an orange bucket into the murky depths of an open pit to collect muddy water. It&#8217;s early morning in October, but the temperature&#8217;s already approaching 90 degrees. Crops of corn and beans have long since shriveled to dust, and emaciated goats scrounging for food in the sand no longer can feed a family or fetch a good price at market.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Six months pregnant, Pushaina often thinks about the baby son she lost to an infection two years ago. She now fears for her young daughter, who often lacks clean water and receives little nourishment apart from a few swallows of <i>chicha</i>, a fermented corn drink.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Since the region’s crippling drought began three years ago, 12 children among Pushaina&#8217;s hundred extended family members have died from malnutrition, dehydration, or illnesses caused by consuming dirty, stagnant water from the earthen wells. Many mothers in this indigenous Wayúu community on the Caribbean desert peninsula of Guajira are so malnourished that they are unable to produce milk for their babies.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Long before dawn breaks, women from the <i>ranchería</i> of Porciosa set out into the night with battered plastic containers, walking for hours across the sweltering desert to retrieve clean water from the nearest potable wells. They haul it back by burro or on bicycles, or lacking those, they carry it themselves. If they can&#8217;t carry enough to meet their families&#8217; needs, they must resort to consuming water from Porciosa&#8217;s two pit wells, which are contaminated with bacteria. It&#8217;s an arduous daily ritual carried out in Wayúu rancherías, or settlements, across the state of La Guajira.</p>
<div id="attachment_327" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0648.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-327" class="wp-image-327 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0648-1024x683.jpg" alt="DSC_0648" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0648-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0648-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0648-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0648-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-327" class="wp-caption-text">Women in Porciosa load plastic containers filled with dirty water from the community&#8217;s two artisanal wells.

</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The word <i>víctima</i> in Colombia has a strong association with the country&#8217;s long-running armed conflict. But as the Colombian government moves steadily toward a peace accord, it is grappling with how to respond to a new kind of victim—people forced from their homes as they suffer the effects of higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more extreme droughts and floods.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The Wayúu&#8217;s plight underscores a broader challenge for Colombia: analyzing the climate-related tipping points that could make people already suffering poverty, conflict, or other environmental threats more likely to migrate, particularly to its crowded cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It&#8217;s an emerging concern all around the world, yet consensus on the best ways forward remains elusive. When the United Nations climate talks commence in Paris on November 30, climate-related migration is likely to garner only a small amount of space in the accord&#8217;s text. That leaves individual countries to devise their own approaches to measuring migration and displacement and safeguarding rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Worldwide an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced each year since 2008 by natural disasters related to extreme weather and climate change, according to the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nrc.no/?aid=9137092#.VkyO-SnDbJ-">Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, part of the Norwegian Refugee Council.</a></p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;We are moving beyond the social conflict already occurring in the country toward a different vulnerability, and some of those [affected] people have no recognition and no future unless we try to understand what&#8217;s happening with migration,&#8221; says Elsa Garcia Salazar, an environmental monitor specializing in climate change at the Bogotá office of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.iom.int">International Organization for Migration</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Crisis in La Guajira</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>For centuries, the Wayúu have resourcefully adapted to seasonal dry periods by migrating within their territory, which extends across the border to Venezuela. But the region&#8217;s unprecedented drought is exacerbating the effects of armed conflict, environmental degradation, and government neglect, driving many in this tribe of some 400,000 to a point of crisis.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very critical, the situation of our community,&#8221; says Arico Pushaina, a community leader in Porciosa. &#8220;If the government doesn&#8217;t help us … the Wayúu will come to an end in this land.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Scientists at <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.ideam.gov.co/">IDEAM,</a> Colombia&#8217;s institute of hydrology and meteorology, attribute Guajira&#8217;s three-year drought to repeated El Niños, a weather phenomenon causing hot and dry conditions there. But recent research says the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n2/full/nclimate2100.html">frequency of these extreme El Niño events</a> has increased due to global warming. And with <a class="ui-link" href="http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/pubs/rp/caribbean-full-eng.pdf">more intense droughts </a>predicted for this region, the fate of the people who call this windswept desert home remains uncertain.</p>
<div id="attachment_330" style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/03colombiaclimatechange.ngsversion.1448028005110.adapt_.676.1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-330" class="wp-image-330 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/03colombiaclimatechange.ngsversion.1448028005110.adapt_.676.1.jpg" alt="03colombiaclimatechange.ngsversion.1448028005110.adapt.676.1" width="676" height="442" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/03colombiaclimatechange.ngsversion.1448028005110.adapt_.676.1.jpg 676w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/03colombiaclimatechange.ngsversion.1448028005110.adapt_.676.1-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-330" class="wp-caption-text">Altamira Epieyu tends two children in the ranchería of Porciosa, a Wayúu community hard hit by drought.

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Across Guajira Peninsula&#8217;s 9,700 square miles, a staggering 37,000 people suffer from malnutrition, according to a <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.defensoria.gov.co/public/pdf/informedefensorialguajira11.pdf">2014 report</a> by Colombia&#8217;s Ombudsman Office. Its hunger crisis intensified in August, when Venezuela closed its border and imposed strict checkpoints to fight contraband gasoline, food, and other products flowing into Colombia. Since then, the Wayúu have found it harder to get cheaper Venezuelan goods, making a bad economy even worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The drought also is exacerbating another serious water woe: the damming of the Río Ranchería, the main river that flows through La Guajira. The river was dammed in large part to quench the voracious thirst of mining companies, resulting in its flow being cut off from the Wayúu. The Wayúu are now <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.las2orillas.co/como-llego-el-caso-wayuu-la-cidh/">petitioning</a> the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to restore their access.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>No one in Porciosa has yet migrated outside of traditional Wayúu territory. But in nearby communities, some—particularly younger people—have left for other Colombian states, according to local leaders.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Garcia wants to know whether the drought is altering the Wayúu&#8217;s traditional migration patterns and pushing them in greater numbers toward urban areas and neighboring states. There&#8217;s an urgent need, she says, for rigorous data collection tools that can aid policymakers in understanding how phenomena linked to climate change are contributing to human migration—not only in La Guajira but throughout the country.</p>

</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p><a class="ui-link" href="http://www.cgdev.org/page/mapping-impacts-climate-change">One study</a> ranks Colombia 18th in the world for climate change risks—two to three times the risk of neighboring Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador: From expansive agricultural lands to urban centers in the Andes to nearly 2,000 miles of coastline, the majority of Colombians live in places likely to be affected by extreme weather, sea level rise, and other phenomena exacerbated by global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of challenges with climate change issues,&#8221; says Rodrigo Suárez Castaño, director of the climate change division at Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. &#8220;If things keep going this way, we&#8217;re going to have more people moving and more people living in cities. It&#8217;s a big question and challenge we have on our hands.&#8221;</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Colombia&#8217;s Wake-up Call</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Last year, Colombia became one of the first countries in South America to include migration in its <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.minambiente.gov.co/index.php/component/content/article/476-plantilla-cambio-climatico-32">national climate change adaptation plan</a>.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>A pivotal event for the Colombian government in recognizing the potential for climate-induced migration was the devastating, widespread La Niña floods in 2010 and 2011, which affected more than three million people throughout the country. There is no clear data on how many people were ultimately displaced, but flooding and mudslides damaged nearly 500,000 homes and affected millions of acres of agricultural lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It was a wake-up call. Following the floods, the government collaborated with the International Organization for Migration to track 2,000 people who had been displaced—an initial step toward a national climate migration study. The survey revealed trends similar to those seen in conflict displacement. Two years after the floods, nearly half had not yet returned home. Many had migrated to large cities like Medellín, Bogotá, and Cartagena.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Like those displaced by conflict, people displaced by the flooding lost property, income, and social support networks. They often settled informally on the fringe of cities in undesirable areas lacking basic infrastructure. People arriving from rural agricultural regions also tended to lack skills necessary to find jobs in an urban economy.</p>
<div id="attachment_322" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-image-322 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg" alt="DSC_0662" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-caption-text">Wayuu women return to Porciosa after filling plastic containers with dirty water from the village&#8217;s two artisanal wells.  (Credit: Autumn Spanne)</p></div>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The small study underscored that cities need to be prepared to receive new migrants as part of their own climate adaptation plans. So far, they lack systems for preparing for them.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Can the Cities Cope?</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Take the Colombian city of Cartagena. The city is home to tens of thousands of displaced conflict victims, many of whom settle informally along the major coastal lagoon of Cienaga de la Virgen with no sewer, water, or other municipal services. The arrival of more people because of climate-related phenomena—like flooding to the city&#8217;s south, rising seas that threaten the islands off its coast, and drought in La Guajira—will add to the pressures.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>But while Cartagena has one of the most advanced adaptation plans in the region, the city hasn&#8217;t yet developed a strategy for climate migration. Suárez says the national government is supporting such efforts by providing guidelines.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t make a commitment to getting solid data about patterns of climate migration, we will not have adequate tools for decision-making,&#8221; says Dolly González, Cartagena&#8217;s city planning director. &#8220;People who arrive in Cartagena because of climate change are staying outside of the government aid programs, because the focus has been conflict.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Beyond counting and tracking migrants, governments face challenges in developing legal mechanisms to provide ongoing support after initial crises like floods and fires. In Colombia, those fleeing extreme weather aren&#8217;t covered by the same laws that protect the rights of conflict-displaced migrants. So far, there isn&#8217;t even a standardized international definition of what constitutes a climate migrant.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The big question now is whether migration and displacement will be included in a new UN climate accord. Ahead of Paris, some developing nations proposed a new entity to organize humanitarian responses to climate-related disasters.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>There&#8217;s general agreement that climate migration will grow in coming decades, notes Walter Kaelin of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.nanseninitiative.org">Nansen Initiative</a>, which is working to improve international responses to people displaced by natural disasters. But providing compensation for affected countries is a sticking point. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have something in the Paris outcome, it will be much more difficult to keep this on the list of priorities,&#8221; he says.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>A Plea to Preserve a Culture</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Back in Porciosa, Virginia Pushaina watches her 19-month-old daughter grow weak and cry for food. She notices that the toddler has the same skin rash that her son developed before contracting a fatal infection. But she doesn&#8217;t have much time to dwell on such unsettling thoughts. Each day she must give herself completely to the present: tending her daughter, walking miles to fetch water, and making <i>mochilas</i>, intricately-woven cotton bags popular with tourists that have become crucial to the economic survival of many Wayúu families.</p>
<div id="attachment_321" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-321" class="wp-image-321" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-683x1024.jpg" alt="DSC_0714" width="505" height="757" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-200x300.jpg 200w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-533x800.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-321" class="wp-caption-text">Virginia Pushaina stands at the grave of her 11-month-old son, who died two years ago of an infection that she believes was caused by drinking dirty water from the community&#8217;s artisanal open pit wells. (Credit: Autumn Spanne)</p></div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Arico Pushaina pleads for greater government investment, including deeper wells, new windmills and solar pumps, medical clinics, and programs that allow artisans to get a fairer price for their goods.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>He worries that, if La Guajira&#8217;s droughts become more intense and prolonged, the young will no longer be able to rely on traditional economic activities such as livestock and subsistence agriculture. What future will the Wayúu have, he wonders, if they are forced to leave for crime-ridden cities, far removed from their culture?</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>His uncertainty about the future also stems from another source. Contaminated water has contributed to the death of ten elders since the drought began, says Pushaina. With them goes their precious cultural knowledge, including the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.festival.si.edu/blog/2013/what-did-you-dream-wayuu-dream-interpretation/">Wayúu tradition</a> of using dreams to plan for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;When they interpret dreams, they inform the community about what&#8217;s to come. It has really affected us, the [loss of] elders,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We no longer know what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a trans-Himalayan region that receives less than 200 millimetres of rain a year, erratic rain and snowfall have led to a deepening water crisis.</p>
<p>Known formerly as the Kingdom of Lo, and open to outsiders only in 1992, Upper Mustang still has an air of mystery around it. Bordering China on the north and situated in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, it is famous for its arid mountains, steep cliffs and dry ochre-coloured landscape. The region is heavily influenced by Tibetan culture, as is evident by the many monasteries, prayer wheels and Chortens (shrines), spread throughout its villages.</p>

<p>For centuries, the Wayúu people of Colombia have resourcefully adapted to seasonal dry periods by migrating within their territory, which extends across the border to Venezuela. But the region's unprecedented drought is exacerbating the effects of armed conflict, environmental degradation, and government neglect, driving many in this tribe of some 400,000 to a point of crisis.</p>

<p>The Jordan Valley, which encompasses modern day Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, has long been considered the region’s food basket. But the once cascading waters of the Jordan River – the lifeblood of its fertile grounds – have been reduced in many places to a mere trickle, victim of transboundary squabbling over water rights that is devastating the traditional livelihoods of the region’s Palestinian farmers.</p>

<p>Egypt is getting hotter with every passing year. As of 2010, <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/ccl16/teco/documents/ppt/TECO-Presentations-PDF/01-7-2014/Session6/1500-1520/4-Presentation1for_conf_1jul.pdf">data from the Egyptian Meteorological Authority</a> showed that Egypt’s five hottest years in recorded history have occurred from the year 2002 onward. The data also showed that heatwaves are becoming more common and prolonged. From 2001 to 2010, Aswan recorded over 100 days with temperatures in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher—whereas in the 70s, that number was closer to 40, the study showed. And as this past summer revealed, the heat is starting to take its toll.</p>

<p>For all his life, 60-year-old Abdul Rehman Dar had proudly tilled the land on his three-acre farm in the highly productive Kashmir Valley. But his work came to a sudden halt when the surging Vishu River flattened two-thirds of his village and damaged hundreds of acres of prized agricultural land in September 2014. As the initial shock of devastation and loss wears off, those struggling to recover from extreme weather events with little help are facing long-term psychological impacts. </p>

<p>As winter tightens its grip over Pakistan’s Kalash valleys, home to the ancient Kalash tribe, many parts of the mountain region are still struggling to repair the damage wrought by the floods this monsoon. The floodwaters brought down boulders, trees and whatever else was in their way, destroying orchards, fields, water channels and roads. Today the road to Rumbur Valley – an hour’s drive from the larger Bumburet Valley – is barely open. At a certain point, one must travel by foot to the villages beyond a bridge that has miraculously survived.</p>

<p>Flash flooding has always been a danger in the valleys at the base of the Sinai Mountains. The hard, dry ground can become saturated in an instant, allowing torrents of water to rush down the mountain like a waterslide, wiping away stretches of road and razing whole villages. But historically, such floods were few and far between. It’s only in the last few years that things have started to change. The Sinai has now been hit by a series of fierce, unexpected, and unprecedented floods, and its people are struggling to protect themselves from the torrents.</p>
