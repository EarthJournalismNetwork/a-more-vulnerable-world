	<p>As they take off into the wild, surrounded by resin trees, the morning light illuminates four wanderers in their jungle sanctuary. “We call this place our home. This is where we feel protected,” they explain.</p>
<p>Hein Yeun, Loun Keuth and his dad Loun Hon, and their friend Srey Tey (see photo from left to right) belong to the Kuy indigenous community. One of the largest ethnic groups in Cambodia, the Kuy live in harmony with the forest, living mostly off what Prey Lang has to offer.</p>
<div class="map">
<p>A relocation site for the Kuy minority during the Khmer Rouge period, the village of Phneak Rolerk is now home to over 100 families.</p>
<p>Located at the edge of the forest, it is one of the most remote places in Cambodia. Access is limited to one road, making it hard to get food and goods from the city. For the past two generations, the community has been living sustainably by relying on the forest and surrounding land to  survive.</p>
<p>Prey Lang provides an abundant source of resources and blesses the Kuy community with farmland, food, medicine, rattan, vines, and other natural gifts that the villagers can use and rely on.</p>
<p>In Phneak Rolerk, life follows the organic rhythm of nature, rooted in the essence of community life: harmony with the environment.</p>
<h2><b>Tapping resin</b></h2>
<p>Every week, Hon, Keuth,Yeun, Tey, and other members of their community enter the forest to tap the remaining resin trees.</p>
<p>“We have a deep connection with Prey Lang because we look for its natural products. The forest is like our nurturing mother,” Hon explains. </p>
<p>A 50-year old farmer, Hon learned how to collect resin from his parents. He now is passing the trade on to his 23-year-old son, Keuth. Proud of his Kuy roots and traditions, Keuth explains how they collect the precious extract.</p>
<p>“During the rainy season, it takes about a week to collect the resin from the tree. You have to come twice to the same tree. First, you notch the bark, burn the fluid and cover it with leaves. Then, a week later, you burn it back and collect it with a bucket,” he says.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Hon and his fellow tappers have been able to harvest at least a barrel of resin a day, but this year they collected only half of that amount. Its value has also plummeted. In 2014, it was estimated at about $10.25 per 30 liters. In 2015, the villagers were receiving only half of that price. In Cambodia, resin tappers sell their product to traders and transporters, for domestic and foreign retailers.</p>
<p>Resin is a multipurpose material that has a variety of uses in the Mekong region, from sealing boats to varnishing homes. Its annual global value in Cambodia is <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp28e.pdf" target="_blank">estimated at $6 million</a>. </p>
<p>“Resin is the main source of income for the community,” Hon explains. ”Losing the forest is like losing our living,” he says.</p>
<h2>A spirit mandate</h2>
<p>A community strongly tied to their animist beliefs, the Kuy people say that the Neaktah—or ancestral spirits— have blessed their presence in the forest. The Neaktah watch over people and places as long as they are paid respect through prayers and offerings.</p>
<p>Every year, the villagers gather to ask Neaktah for fertile land and seed their hopes for abundant harvests for the year to come. “We change every year and come back to the original land every three or four years,” Hon explains.</p>

<section id="chapter-438374" class="chapter atavist-section chapter-type-0 web chapter-438374 chapter-type-text ">
<p>Saom Than, a 48-year-old farmer explains that the Neaktah are protective spirits that watch over the community. “Each village has their own, and the land belongs to them,” he says.</p>
<p>According to Kuy beliefs, the Neaktah ensure safety to the people by warding off imminent threats. “Neaktah always provide for the people. We can find fruits when we are hungry and we do not have to worry from wild animals. But now that the forest is gone, I do not feel like I am protected anymore,” Saom Than confides.</p>
<p>As Prey Lang’s trees vanish from the activities of illegal loggers, so too, the Kuy believe, do the Neaktah spirits. “If the forest dies, we die”—say many in the community, fearful that disappearing spirits will leave the Kuy people vulnerable and unprotected.</p>

	<p>"What are we going to do?”</p>
<p>Wandering in the midst of down-turned yellow rice stems, Hon is worried about this year’s harvest. “Before, we had regular rain and our crops were better,” he says, showing dead corn. “Look at it now.”</p>
<p>The Kuy community has long been self-sufficient, mainly relying on harvesting rice and using products from the forest. But yields have declined over the past eight years and the community has observed changes in rainfall.</p>
<p>“Since 2007, it has become hotter and storms prevent us from going to the jungle and our farmland,” Srey Tey says, his voice heavy with regret. “I have been living here all my life. The trees do not produce as many fruits anymore. Usually, if there is enough humidity, they grow. But this is no more the case.” Tey says this has also contributed to the decline in resin earnings.</p>
<p>Nodding, Hon emphasizes the significance of regular rain. “In this village, the daily life of the community moves in time with the water. When there is rain, there is work,” he says.</p>
<p>As the sun rises over rows of rice fields, paddy workers are already feeling the immense heat. “It is supposed to be the beginning of the harvesting season, but we do not really know when this is anymore,” Hon says with a lump in his throat. “It has become random.”</p>

	<h2>The vicious cycle of deforestation</h2>
<p>For the Kuy people, walking in the forest under such heat feels as oppressive as seeing it vanish. “Before, there were more trees and the rain was regular. If this year stays dry, we will collect less resin,” Hon says. “This is because of illegal logging.”</p>
<p>The loss of forest cover is likely having a major impact on local rain cycles and scientists estimate that deforestation is responsible for up to one-sixth of global carbon emissions, which contribute to warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>In addition to sheltering the Kuy people, Prey Lang also provides crucial habitat for endangered flora and fauna species, some of which are only found in Cambodia. But as the weather keeps changing, these species continue to disappear.</p>
<p>Traditional medicine collectors in the forest villages have observed the extinction of specific plants that had been used to treat various ailments. “The elder of the village tells me that it is very difficult to find effective plants nowadays,” Saom Than claims. “I sometimes still go to the forest to find medicine, but I never find everything I want,” he says.</p>

	<p>In the Kuy dialect, Prey Lang means “our forest.” The community calls it home and has been living here for at least two generations. Spanning four provinces and covering 3,600 square kilometers, Prey Land is considered to be the largest evergreen forest in the country and likely the most expansive in Indochina.</p>
<div id="attachment_689" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-689" class="wp-image-689 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-1024x723.jpg" alt="Prey-Lang Map" width="633" height="447" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-1024x723.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-300x212.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Prey-Lang-Map-1020x720.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /><p id="caption-attachment-689" class="wp-caption-text">Land use patterns near Prey Lang.

<h2>A vanishing place</h2>
<p>While Prey Lang is a source of life for the community, it is a constant source of worries too. Speaking in her home where villagers gather before heading out on patrols, Hon’s sister sees troubled times ahead. “As a minority, even if we can mark our land, we have no land title,” she says. This means they can be evicted at any time.</p>
<p>Local activist Phouk Hong, a 40-year-old mother of five, agrees and says the community’s claim to their beloved forest is under threat.</p>
<p>“Prey Lang was full of precious wood. This led companies to come here and cut the precious trees. There is almost none of them left and this has a great impact on the biodiversity and our livelihood,” she says.</p>
<p>One of her neighbors, Un Vien, is angry at the local authorities for what he says are injustices committed against the Kuy people. “The forest keeps vanishing since 1997,” he says. “When we carry small piece of wood to our houses, we can be arrested. But when whole trucks full of precious wood were going to Phnom Penh or Koh Kong to be shipped away, none of them are arrested. How come the local police cannot see this?” he angrily asks pointing at a felled tree log.</p>
<p>And as his voice slowly disappears between the leaves, Vien rushes trough a narrow path only to discover more felled trees. But this, he says, only strengthens his commitment to saving the forest.</p>
<h2>Feeding over a million people</h2>
<p>The loss of the Prey Lang forest <a class="regular-link" href="http://preylang.net/download/reports/Monitor-Report2_April-July-2015_english_final-version_reduced-file-size.pdf" target="_blank">would affect at least 1.5 million people in the Mekong region</a>. Over time, the future of the forest could play an important role in the fate of the larger Mekong region.</p>
<p>“Prey Lang has valuable ecological importance [and its] ecosystem plays critical roles in [the] water regulation between the Tonle Sap and Mekong Basins,” a representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Phnom Penh explains. The Tonle Sap is one of the world’s most productive freshwater ecosystems. So productive that it has earned the lake the nickname “Cambodia’s beating heart.”</p>
</p>
<p>The Kuy community is well aware of the situation. Hong, for example, has become a dedicated activist that is committed to protecting the remaining forest for her, her family, and her community, but also all the people she knows are benefiting from Prey Lang.</p>
<p>“You start to realize what is going on when your livelihood is threatened. My family and I lived off the resin trees; now that they are less, we need to organize ourselves to protect them,” she says, fully aware of the change it will bring to her family’s life. “I have to go to the capital often to coordinate our actions with other activists. Sometimes, I wish I could just stay in the farm and take care of what I have here,” she admits.</p>
<p>But Hong says the fight is larger than her life. The threats to Prey Lang put the future of her family and the community in danger of losing their main source of income and their traditional way of life. For the Kuy people, protecting the forest has become a matter of survival.</p>

	<p>In the dark of night, the glow of a fire leaves a faint light on faces weary from days of walking in the jungle. The group of ten lies awake in their makeshift camp, hoping for a strong breeze to fan their dying fire.</p>
<p>Voices carry from the distance, broken occasionally by the persistent sound of chainsaws. Loggers are working under the cover of darkness. Tonight, they will cut enough trees until their truck is loaded or they stop to catch a few hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Back at the camp, the Kuy patrol is conflicted. Some want to leave the camp now and catch the loggers in the act, but to do so could be dangerous.</p>
<p>“Safety comes first. At night, we cannot access nor see anything. We don’t know if the loggers possess any weapon or gun, and we are not enough to patrol,” Hong explains. “We should wait until the morning,” she concludes.</p>
<p>But the night will be short for most of the patrollers. No one can sleep listening to the loggers carry out their work.</p>
<p>The Kuy people feel at home in this forest. In better times, the fires were a place to tell stories from the past, and communicate regrets and hopes. This is where experiences are shared, questions asked and spirits built.</p>
<p>Tonight, the patrol lies still in the darkness, hoping that the sun will soon rise to shed light on the strangers attempting to steal Prey Lang’s trees.</p>
<h2>Hostile surroundings</h2>
<p>It is still dark when the patrol rises and begins to pack up camp. Hong’s eyes sparkle as she explains their strategy. “We will leave now and walk until we reach the loggers’ area. At that point, we will split in teams to surround them, guided by the sound of their chainsaws. When the signal is given, we will all [rush in].”</p>
<p>Her voice is as soft and quiet as her footsteps, but the chainsaws are louder than ever before. Suddenly the patrol breaks out into a full run.</p>
<p>All of the loggers’ equipment is quickly seized. “We confiscate knives, axes and chainsaws. Everything that they can use against us and allow then to react violently,” Hong explains, struggling to catch her breath.</p>
<p>The patrollers then take the names of the two loggers and have them sign an agreement with their thumbprints never to come back to log in Prey  Lang.</p>
<p>Although the Prey Lang Community Network has taken it upon themselves to defend the forest, they do not have any authority to arrest the loggers or store the wood and chainsaws. But they carefully retain these signed documents, hoping it will make a difference. “When wood is confiscated, we inform the local pagoda about it and everything is delivered there. We have had very bad experience with the local authorities in the past. They never collaborate with us to protect the forest, even if it is their duty. When we trust them and gave them what we confiscated, they generally gave all equipment back to the loggers. The community is doing the government’s job,” Hong explains.</p>
<p>Instead the patrol now uses acid to destroy the internal mechanism of the chainsaws. Sand is sometimes also used. One by one, they also cut the wooden planks they find on site.</p>
<h2>Patrolling the forest</h2>
<div id="attachment_672" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-672" class="wp-image-672 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-1024x683.jpg" alt="024_RAA_6647" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-1020x681.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/024_RAA_6647-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-672" class="wp-caption-text">Ma Lom, Teon Roeun, Sean Khoeun and Vong Sophy, members of the Prey Lang Community Network, during a patrol in Prey Lang forest. © Antoine Raab / Ruom</p></div>
<p>Every other month, about 20 network members will embark on similar journeys through the forest to catch illegal loggers. The bigger the group, the less likely they will be confronted with violence. “We all do this together,” Hong says.</p>
<p>More than a patrol, the journey through the forest is an ancestral Kuy practice. Like nomadic herders, they choose a new home every night and believe they are protected by the spirits of the forest. Although these journeys now carry a much more somber purpose, the Kuy share laughter and stories that remind them of the sovereignty of the surrounding  trees.</p>
<div class="swiper-container swiper-container-horizontal">
<h2>Advocacy on the Internet</h2>
<p>Deep in the forest, modernity is catching up quickly for the better.</p>
<p>Hong’s nephew Keuth is 23 years-old. He has been actively involved in the protection of Prey Lang since he was a child. “My father first joined the Network and I did like him.” he says proudly. “I belong to the Prey Lang Youth and I have gathered my friends in the village to join in protecting the forest.”</p>
<p>Keuth joined his dad on his first forest patrol a decade ago. “At first, I was scared,” he admits, “but now I am not afraid anymore.”</p>
<p>Keuth now takes part in every patrol and never leave his smartphone at home.</p>
<div id="attachment_692" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692" class="size-large wp-image-692" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-1024x683.jpg" alt="Loun Keuth, 23, farmer and activist, records and documents every patrol he takes part in with his smartphone, using the Prey Lang App. © Antoine Raab / Ruom" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-1020x681.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/053_RAA_8509-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-692" class="wp-caption-text">Loun Keuth, 23, farmer and activist, records and documents every patrol he takes part in with his smartphone, using the Prey Lang App. © Antoine Raab / Ruom</p></div>
<p>Keuth is a new generation of forest activist who sees value in using social media to raise awareness. “Posting on Facebook is really helpful because we can publish proof of illegal logging,” he says. “We want to let countries see what is happening to our forest and we would like them to help us protect it.”</p>
</div>
<p>Through social networks, the Prey Lang Community Network has been publishing regular reports to summarize the data collected. “I believe that if people see what is going on with their own eyes, they will take an interest. This is not only addressed to foreigners, I also want to let other Cambodians know how much of the Prey Lang forest is still standing,” Keuth explains. Up until September, the Network recorded at least 2,000 forest crimes in Prey Lang, from corruption to license abuses. </p>
<section id="chapter-625098" class="chapter atavist-section chapter-type-0 web chapter-625098 chapter-type-text ">
<p>"What the Network is doing deters small loggers,” Fran Lambrick, an ethnobiologist and film maker who has been studying the Prey Lang forest in the past 5 years, says. “But the bigger fish—the ones logging illegally for large companies—are organized differently. They have moving sawmills for example, and they also treat the forest as it is their own property,” she explains, commending the courage of the communities fighting back.</p>
<p>But danger to the forest and its dwellers looms large. In recent months, there’s been an uptick in environmental activists being killed and arrested. Both Tey and Hong have received threats from local authorities. The death of Chut Wutty, a prominent environmental activist who was killed in 2012, stills weighs heavily on the community.</p>
<p>“If we do not take care of the forest, who will?” Hong asks. But the loggers are a persistent threat. A company was recently granted a license to log parts of the forest is a known foe. “We already kicked them out in 2000 when we submitted a petition to our King Sihanouk,” Vien explains. But King Sihanouk passed away in 2012 and this time, the concession will be legal. There’s a long road ahead, but the Kuy activists intend to keep defending their forest on their own, one log at a time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A boy named Nguyen Van Trong walked cautiously along a ditch while keeping his eyes trained on the ground. Every day he returns to this mangrove forest to search for discarded plastic bottles that he can sell. On a good day, he can make up to two dollars, which helps to supplement his family’s income. They are among the many in Cha Va village who are losing their farmland because of sea level rise.</p>
<div id="attachment_120" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151104112333-img-3405.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120" class="size-full wp-image-120" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151104112333-img-3405.jpg" alt="A boy collects plastic bottles to sell for money to help his family in Cha Va village, Lam Hai commune, Nam Can district, Ca Mau province.

<h2>Tarnished gold</h2>
<p>Ca Mau is Vietnam’s southernmost province and an important part of the country’s agricultural economy. The Mekong Delta region produces much of the country’s food and exports, but in the “Golden Rice Bowl,” poverty is increasing.</p>
<p>Here rice has become more expensive to produce than to sell —the result of unfavorable government policies and high costs along the production and distribution chain. Struggling farmers also face mounting pressures from changing weather patterns and the region’s intricate system of rivers and canals is being inundated with salinity from the rising ocean.</p>
<p>Rice growers in the southern provinces typically farm land that is small and fragmented, which leaves individual farmers with higher input costs and little control over supply and resulting price. Recognizing the importance of rice to Vietnam’s economy, the government instituted a floor price policy to ensure that farmers earn a 30 percent profit.</p>
<p>But enterprises rarely buy rice directly from farmers and any extra profit from higher prices goes to middle-man brokers instead. It’s a policy that’s especially damaging, said Mr. Nguyen Van Doi who manages an agricultural cooperative in Dong Thap province, because these brokers put a price squeeze on farmers, and then store and sell the product at significantly higher prices.</p>

<p>Nguyen Thi Nga lives in Kien Giang where she used to farm, but now picks up trash to make ends meet. Much of her land was lost to sea level rise and she passed on what remained to her children. Like many others in her village, she is unable to find steady work and lives in a makeshift home built near the trunk of a tree. Often when the river floods its banks, these homes are swept away, leaving Nga and her neighbors to grab their few belongings and move on.</p>
<h2>People on the move</h2>
<p>These “floating” populations are growing in number in Vietnam’s southern provinces. In addition to out-of-work farmers, there are large numbers of migrant workers who don’t have land or other skills to support their large families. Low education levels, training and available jobs are major causes of chronic poverty.</p>
<p>Nguyen Van Thoi, who lives in nearby Nam Can, has no land or farm, just a poorly constructed bamboo house that sits precariously along the riverbank. When the house collapses or washes away, his family moves to another location and rebuilds. Without any land or trade to pass on to their children, this cycle of poverty continues.</p>

<p>“Our lives here depend entirely on the rivers. [Some] days, I go fishing; on dry days…I do whatever others hire,” he said. With little rainfall over the past few months, however, earning has been difficult. In the Mekong Delta region, annual per capita income is one of the lowest in the country at $1,535 (about 34.6 million VND). The national average is just over $2,000 (46.2 million VND).</p>
<p>Professor Vu Trong Khai, an independent expert on agricultural economics and rural development, said that the rise in untrained, unemployed workers is a major challenge. Although the Mekong Delta has an abundant labor force, those who farm often do so using traditional or primitive methods, which results in the low production levels and income despite their great efforts. This also makes them vulnerable to many intermediaries, who purchase their rice at lower prices and then sell it for two to three times higher.</p>
<p>Children in the southern provinces are also suffering. According to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Education and Training, the percentage of children early dropping out of school in the Mekong Delta region is three times higher than the rest of the country. Schools in this area lack even the most basic facilities. Low education rates prevent next generations of Mekong people from accessing new skills and better opportunities, instead tying them to unstable, low-paid work in agriculture and manual production.</p>

<p>To help farmers escape from poverty, Professor Khai said it is necessary to train young laborers on professional production methods. Otherwise, the Mekong Delta will continue to rely on cheap labor and an increasingly unpredictable environment, making their source of livelihood less reliable and stable. Already, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion has caused a significant loss in viable agricultural land.</p>
<p>Many places like Dong Thap and Can Tho are especially vulnerable and have left people fleeing the advancing sea. But many lack the training and skills to find alternative jobs in the market economy or industrial goods production.</p>
<p>Warming temperatures and rising seas are threatening the second largest rice exporter in the world, but it’s the grinding poverty across the Mekong Delta region that is most visible. Without a development plan for Vietnam’s southern provinces, the lives of the people may be quickly washed away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northern Nigeria is a region of vast arable land, capable of feeding the entire country with enough left to export. Yet millions of its inhabitants have been uprooted in their own country, victims of the advancing Sahara Desert that is moving southward at a rate of 0.6 kilometers per year.</p>
<p>The resulting land deterioration leaves formerly productive fields barren and unfit for human habitation, which threatens not only food security but economic and social stability. Nigeria is one of the nations most at risk with 11 northern states at the front lines, including Kebbi, Zamfara, Gombe, Yobe, Adamawa and Bauchi.</p>
<p>Reports say that Nigeria loses at least 35,000 hectares of its arable land annually to desert encroachment in the north. This is comparable to the size of Lagos State, Nigeria&#8217;s economic capital and its most populous region. According to Alhaji Garba Sale, the Director of Forestry and Ecology in Kano State, one major consequence of northern desert encroachment is the massive migration of the people due to the loss of farmlands, a situation that puts pressure on food production in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major socio-economic impact of desert encroachment is the loss of farmlands. Immediately following that is migration syndrome because once the local population loses their farmlands, the alternative option for them is to relocate and unfortunately they relocate to urban areas,” said Sale. “By moving to the cities, we are creating more mouths to be fed while farm produce is reduced. This is a big problem. No nation can survive if this is allowed to go on.”</p>
<div id="attachment_651" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-651" class="size-large wp-image-651" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-1024x768.jpg" alt="Alhaji Garba Sale (Credit: Augustina Armstrong-Ogbonna)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-300x225.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sale-1020x765.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-651" class="wp-caption-text">Alhaji Garba Sale (Credit: Augustina Armstrong-Ogbonna)</p></div>
<p>A tour of some of the affected states, including Katsina, Kano, and Sokoto, reveals that rainfall—still heavy in some southern states—has been dramatically reduced, many streams have dried up and crops have withered on the vine. According to a 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), &#8220;agricultural production and food security (including access to food) in many African countries and regions are likely to be severely compromised by climate change and climate variability.”</p>
<p>A number of countries in Africa already face semi-arid conditions that make agriculture challenging and climate change will likely to reduce the length of growing season as well as eliminate large regions of formerly productive agricultural land. Projected yield reductions in some countries “could be as much as 50% by 2020, and crop net revenues could fall by as much as 90% by 2100, with small-scale farmers being the most affected.”</p>
<p>Along the border with the Niger Republic, farmers complain that crop yields have reduced by as much as 80%. Farm lands which used to produce over ten bundles of millet now can barely produce two due to ravaging deserts that are leaving a trail of poverty in their path.</p>
<p>Sambo Issah, a local leader in the farming community said that further intervention is needed from the government. Research into quick maturing crop species, for example, is critical since the rainy season has drastically shortened to about three months per year. Issah said the government has promised to create a four kilometer long shelter belt, or line or trees, to protect crop lands from harsh weather and encroaching desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are suffering here in Köngo Village, in Mai Adua Local government. Here we face many environmental problems such as erosion and desert encroachment. This has caused reduction in farm produce while some areas cannot be cultivated at all,” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rainfall keeps reducing each year. Some 10 years ago, we used to witness rainfall for at least 5-6 months and the farm harvest was impressive,” Issah said. “Now we hardly get three months of rainfall.”</p>
<h2><strong>Advancing desert fueling conflict</strong></h2>
<p>Conflict over dwindling land resources has also fueled violence between farmers and nomadic herdsmen, reportedly claiming hundreds of lives over the last five years and mounting economic losses. The group known as the Fulani herdsmen has been accused of raping women, destroying farmlands and inducing inter-ethnic violence as they move from state to state in search of viable grazing land for their flock.</p>
<p>But experts say that herders have long been neglected by federal development programs that favor agrarian farmers. “There is a National Policy on Livestock Agriculture, but that is hardly implemented,” said Mallam Ahmed Bello, a top official with the Confederation of Traditional Herder Organizations in West Africa. Traditional grazing routes, he says, have been overtaken by farmers who use the land for cultivation or information irrigation areas during the dry season. “The herdsmen are aware of the grazing corridors and they know their routes,” he said, “but when these routes are encroached on, we have conflicts.”</p>
<p>Statistics from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture show that more than half of Nigeria’s national grazing routes have been encroached upon. Actions that have sparked “a call to war,” according to Saidu Bala, a herder from Plateau state. “What do you expect from us when our source of existence is threatened?” he asked. “We have no option but to fight back.”</p>
<p>The Islamist insurgency in parts of northern Nigeria has also been linked to the advancing desert. Locals say that Boko Haram militants hide behind the instability caused by poverty and unemployment, and use hopelessness as a recruitment tool.</p>
<h2><strong>A way forward?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Experts say the time is now for the Nigerian government to execute its commitments under the Great Green Wall (GGW) project, a regional initiative to create a wall of trees and block the desert from encroaching southwards.</p>
<p>The wall of trees is expected to run across frontline areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in West Africa, through 11 states in Nigeria to Djibouti in East Africa. Ten years after the GGW project was conceived, it has yet to fully commence in Nigeria. In Katsina State, an area designated for project implementation is waiting to break ground. Trees are still in the nursery, while a solar borehole for watering the plants sits nearby.</p>
<p>But Hussaini Dangari, the Permanent Secretary for Katsina States’s Ministry of the Environment, insists that the project has fully kicked off and was positively affecting host communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katsina state has the greatest number of local governments that the GGW Program covers. The state also is contributing a lot towards the success of this project through not only funding, but also in sensitizing the public to know the importance of it,” Dangari said. “Orchards are also being established so that the communities can use them. The seedlings are raised by the communities themselves.”</p>
<p>In addition to the GGW project, many northern states have their own individual tree planting initiatives, some spanning as long as thirty years, others much newer, but the positive impact they have on farm land is clearly visible. In areas where trees have grown big enough to block the wind, crop yields were high unlike other unprotected areas, as observed in Kongo and Kano state.</p>
<p>Bold steps taken by the Nigerian government to mitigate the impact of northern desert encroachment through the GGW project, in addition to other structured tree planting initiatives and adaptation measures, is a critical step to securing a successful future for the people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the hills of Mariashoni in the eastern part of Kenya’s Mau Forest Complex, sits an old indigenous <em>Yemdit</em> tree with pale orange-green leaves.</p>
<p>A lone ranger, the tree is surrounded by fresh green commercial eucalyptus trees. A single log beehive – a traditional form of beekeeping to the region’s native population – sits firmly attached to its moss green branches.</p>
<p>This forest – almost unrecognizable – is home to Joseph Chemaina, who was born into Kenya’s indigenous Ogiek community in 1958, when the forest was thick with indigenous trees.</p>
<p>While their numbers back then were closer to 200, the Ogiek population within the Mariashoni area has jumped to approximately 1,700 people of voting age – which is 18 in Kenya – but remains only a minute representation of the estimated 15,000 adult Ogieks living in the Mau Forest Complex and 20,000 across Kenya. Because of the limited data on Ogiek families, these numbers are misleading. With an estimated average family size of ten people, the forest’s Ogiek population could actually be closer to 150,000 people.</p>
<p>“I was born in the forest and when I opened my eyes, all I saw was a forest. A thick forest; every inch you moved, a shrub or tree squeezed your shoulders,” said the 57-year-old Chemaina.</p>
<div id="attachment_186" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186" class="size-large wp-image-186" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg" alt="A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-186" class="wp-caption-text">A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Each family had its own territory surrounded with a canopy of trees stretching up to 100 meters high.</p>
<p>Here, high atop these branches, the Ogieks would affix log beehives, the backbone of their simple economy. Honey gathered from these hives provided a reliable source of food, income and medicine.</p>
<p>“Honey was in plenty, one Ogiek could have up to 800 beehives,” said Chemaina.</p>
<p>Bees collected nectar and pollen from the indigenous trees, which flowered in different seasons of the year due to regular rainfall and flowing streams.</p>
<p>Back then, the forest provided an abundant source of food and water for the community and Chemaina said he could pick a variety of wild fruits and hunt for rabbits under its dewy cover. Experience had taught the Ogiek to expect brief rains from February to April before the onset of heavier rainfall during the second half of the year. Never, said Chemaina, did it disappoint them.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the flowering season stretched from November to March and the honey harvest yielded ample returns.</p>
<p>“Each beehive produced more than 100 kilogrammes of honey,” he explained.</p>
<p>The Ogieks consider nectar and pollen from the indigenous <em>Tongotwet</em> and <em>Kureyet</em> trees to be very special, and used the dark brown honey as a remedy for chest, stomach, nerve and bone problems.</p>
<p>It was also used as a cure for injuries and fever in children. Expectant mothers drank the thick, dark substance like milk and it served as a disinfectant and wound sanitizer during delivery.</p>
<p>“We survived without the worry of diseases because honey was a powerful dose of medicine,” Chemaina said. But the once rich supply of these indigenous trees began to diminish after illegal logging, charcoal burning and other human activities caused extensive destruction of the forest. Rainfall patterns became less predictable and many local flowering plants started to disappear.</p>
<div id="attachment_190" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree..jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190" class="size-large wp-image-190" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-190" class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Medicinal honey is now a rarity that the Ogieks are forced to accept.</p>
<p>Chemaina now counts only 37 beehives on his 30-acre territory, compared to some 700 he had until early 1990s. “Bee keeping is my life and the life of Ogieks,” he said. “I want to have that life of dense forest back. I want a reverse of the weather patterns – to have the rains as normal.”</p>
<p>But harvesting has been reduced to once in a year and on many occasions, Chemaina has been forced to skip seasons due to lack of honey. Where he used to get 100 kilogrammes from each beehive, he now gets less than 10.</p>
<p>Despite these weather-related challenges, Chemaina said nothing will detach him from the traditional system of rearing bees. He said the demand for the special medicinal honey is even higher since cold weather ailments are affecting him and fellow community members.</p>
<p>“I still need it to help with my chest and fever. It has now become a common problem I have to deal with and hospitals were never part of our lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Augmenting these environmental stresses, the ruthless destruction of the forest over the last two decades has cost the forest community an abundance of wild rabbits, fruits and indigenous vegetation that is critical to their survival.</p>
<p>As early as 1990, people invaded the Mau forest to burn trees into charcoal, an activity that decimated the forest and drove away much of the bee population. By 2000, this damage had spread to more than 100,000 hectares of the forest.</p>
<p>According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), up to 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex’s 416,000 hectares were destroyed between 1990 and 2001.</p>
<p>Cosmas Ikiugu, head of Mau Conservancy in the Kenya Forest Service, said much of the eastern and western parts of the Mau Forest Complex were heavily degraded.</p>
<p>It’s here that more than 150,000 people – including Ogieks – have illegally settled, extending the destruction that the forestry agency admits is a challenge that requires a multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-194" class="size-large wp-image-194" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg" alt="A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-194" class="wp-caption-text">A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>High carbon emissions, soil erosion and decreased groundwater levels are only some of the byproducts of these damaging human activities.</p>
<p>“By 2008, the Mau River was actually drying up. Lake Nakuru which depends on the river was facing a major problem of low water levels,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Teresia Chemutai, a 53-year-old Ogiek woman, said the community relies on water from the Mau River during the dry period since there is no more water flowing freely under their feet.</p>
<p>Groundwater streams such as Segut, Ndoswa and Napuyapui are now extinct, she said.</p>
<p>Women, she said, never went out to hunt for wild meat, rear or harvest honey to feed their families during their days in the forest. But that has changed.</p>
<p>“There is too much work for Ogiek women nowadays. There have to walk long distances to get water, go out to look for food just as men. They bear the burden of ever sickly chicken and give birth to weak children,” she said.</p>
<p>Under bleak circumstances, the Ogiek have reluctantly moved to crop and livestock farming. But the chemical pesticides used to treat the crops is also threatening what’s left of their precious bees.</p>
<p>Chemutai said she started farming in 1997 after the government apportioned her and a few other Ogieks land in the forest. Non-Ogieks that they refer to as “invaders” also received land allocations and to date, the issue remains a grievance that the government has yet to address.</p>
<p>The Ogieks left without government-granted land started farming areas within the territories they originally inhabited.</p>
<p>Chemutai currently has three acres of maize and one of potatoes, but says the practice has been difficult to learn.</p>
<p>“I have been farming for years now, but I still feel I am not used to it,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_187" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187" class="size-large wp-image-187" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg" alt="Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-187" class="wp-caption-text">Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>And just like the trees and flowering plants that have slowly died off, their crops remain susceptible to changes in the weather patterns.</p>
<p>Dry spells threaten maize and potatoes – the main food staples now grown in this area. Many Ogieks still remember a devastating drought that struck the region in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>“We were shocked and worried over the happenings. The crops dried and very little was available for consumption,” said Joseph Barngetuny, a 56-year-old Ogiek farmer.</p>
<p>Recognizing these challenges to traditional ways of life, Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture is educating members of the Ogiek community on the practice of modern beekeeping. “Traditional beehives are no longer productive due to the changed habitat,” said Phillip Owiti, an apiculture officer with the agricultural ministry. “The bee colonies have reduced as a result of unsuitable conditions for survival.”</p>
<p>So far, he said, they have trained 275 Ogieks from Mariashoni who have embraced modern beekeeping.</p>
<p>“We are making all efforts to help them (Ogieks) change their socio-cultural attachment to the environment because the climate change is not sparing their traditional way of keeping bees,” he said.</p>
<p>But results have been mixed. Joseph Barngetuny is one of the farmers who shifted to modern beekeeping. He currently occupies 30 acres of land in Mariashoni and has eight portable beehives, which unlike the traditional log beehives can be erected on sheds or other structures around a farm.</p>

<p>Each, he said, produces no more than 10 kilogrammes of honey, a low production he partly attributes to lost bee colonies, contaminated flowering plants and lack of adequate water sources.</p>
<p>Because of the inadequate harvest, he must continue to grow maize to meet the financial needs of his 20 children from two wives. Though he consumes the honey he produces, he said it has lost the ingredients that made it a special food for the community.</p>
<p>But even more troubling still, the Ogieks lack legal claim to the land they have worked so tirelessly to till. Though they say it’s their ancestral right, it’s a subject that’s rarely mentioned or talked in community circles.</p>
<p>Nahashon Kiptoo, a member of the Ogiek Council of Elders, compared the community’s lack of title deeds to an open wound awaiting a very strong antidote to heal.</p>
<p>“I have developed ulcers imagining us being displaced from here. We fear of other people acquiring title deeds for the parcels of land we are currently occupying. That will be disastrous to us,” said Kiptoo.</p>
<p>The acquisition of title deeds is just one of their pressing needs. The Ogieks also wish for a section of the forest to be officially declared as their secluded home.</p>
<p>Kiptoo said that since their lives begin and end in the forest, they should be allowed to live freely as they did before.</p>
<p>“We will be very happy to go back to [traditional ways of life in the forest]. We miss that life of jumping from one tree to another like monkeys,” said the elder. “We were very strong. We could fall from a 100 metre tree and never died.”</p>
<p>The Ogieks also want a fresh audit of their members to determine how many are in need of title deeds. Findings of a survey done in 2010 by the Interim Mau Restoration Coordinating Secretariat are yet to be made public.</p>

<p>Joseph Towett, who participated in the survey, said the adult Ogiek population in Mau Forest Complex were originally approximated to be 11,000 people. But he puts the current figure closer to 15,000.</p>
<p>“That list is now outdated and several things have changed since then. We need title deeds, support to establish sustainable livelihoods since climate change has adversely affected our lives. We also need engagement in the conservation of Mau,” said Towett, who also chairs the Ogiek Council of Elders.</p>
<p>Ikiugu, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) official, said their concerns over land ownership and engagement in proactive conservation activities is something the government has and will continue to put effort to address.</p>
<p>“We realize that security over land gives them long-term control over the conservation activities in the area which eventually determines rate of climate change,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Ikiugu said they are encouraging the Ogieks to form Community Forest Associations through which they will legally access the benefits accrued from the forests including allocation of land in the forest for cultivation.</p>
<p>A piece of legislation passed in 2005 legalised a system of forest cultivation to forest adjacent communities. Known as the Plantation Establishment for Livelihoods Scheme (PELIS), it allows for community members to access and manage forest land. They are allowed to graze cows and plant crops on a designated plot of land for three years, as long as they also grow trees with certified seedlings provided by KFS. The seedlings are a mix of indigenous and exotic species, with limitations of what can be harvested for timber, but enforcement remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>So far, officials say that 70,000 hectares have been rehabilitated through concerted efforts between the state’s forestry agency and non-state actors, namely the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), among others.</p>
<p>Exotic species such as eucalyptus, cypress and pine have been introduced in 50,000 hectares while the rest has been restored with indigenous trees, Ikiugu said. He believes that high water levels at the Mau River swelling up Lake Nakuru and Mara River are outcomes of the intensive restoration activities at the water tower.</p>

<p>“There is an overflow of water into Lake Nakuru presently submerging houses belonging to the officials at (Lake Nakuru National Park),” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>But Timothy Kiogora, the Nakuru county environmental director, said he remains concerned over the continued practice of the harmful human activities in the forest. Dealing with it requires commitment from all stakeholders, he said.</p>
<p>“It is one thing to tell people about the effects of destroying the forests and how to conserve it but it becomes another issue in converting the information into results,” said Kiogora.</p>
<p>“For people who depend on the forest, you must be able to give them the best alternative to be able to sustainably protect the forest against any destruction,” he added.</p>
<p>The county official said they have outlined effective strategies on educating communities living in the Mau Forest Complex on use of solar and other energy saving cooking stoves to save the forest.</p>
<p>While the government strives to rehabilitate the Mau Forest Complex and assist the Ogieks in adapting to changes in the climate, the community continues to hope that the bees will return.</p>
<p>“It tells a lot about the value of our environment,” said elder council member Kiptoo. “Only by recognising the value of indigenous trees and the ecosystem they enjoyed will we have again stocks of the honey.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Extreme weather events are destroying the silkworms that produce Assam’s famous golden silk</strong></p>
<p>Assam, in North-east India, produces one of the finest, and most expensive, types of silk in the world. Produced by the semi-domesticated silkworm <em>Antheraea assamensis,</em> which is only found in the Brahmaputra Valley, this silk is called <em>Muga</em> –  Assamese for “yellow” or “amber” –  and is often called golden silk. This silk has been produced in the region from as far back as 321 BC, and is an inextricable part of the life and culture of Assam. Unfortunately silkworms are highly sensitive to climatic conditions since they are grown outdoors. Recently unpredictable rainfall patterns, a rise in temperature and persistent floods have endangered <em>Muga</em> cocoon production across the state.</p>
<p>Due to the long history of sericulture, <em>Muga</em> silk occupies a special place in the lives of the indigenous people, inextricably linked to their cultural life. Moreover <em>Muga silk</em> is one of the most expensive silks in the world due its durability and beauty. The lustre of the fabric increases with each wash, making it a product that is treasured – and which lasts – throughout the lifetime of its owner. In 2007, Assam received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for <em>Muga</em> silk. A GI tag is given to products that are produced in a particular area, and boosts the reputation of the product.</p>
<div id="attachment_40" style="width: 993px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40" class="size-full wp-image-40" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg" alt="A set of mekhela chadors made with Assamese muga silk arranged around a japi (Credit: Satnath)" width="983" height="800" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg 983w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40" class="wp-caption-text">A set of mekhela chadors made with Assamese muga silk arranged around a japi (Credit: Satnath)</p></div>
<p>There is a demand for more than 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of <em>Muga</em> silk annually, but the state has been producing an average 90 mt per year. In 2011-12 the production increased a little to 115 mt, according to sources from the Sericulture Department. However there are fears of negative or stagnant results in the next crop seasons. This year’s crop production was affected by rising temperature and floods.</p>
<h2><strong>A flood of troubles in Dhemaji</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhemaji_district">Dhemaji district</a> in northern Assam is a major <em>Muga</em> growing area. About 98% of the people of the district live in the rural areas and agriculture is the principal occupation for more than 85% of the people. These families are also engaged in <em>Muga</em> cultivation. <em>Muga</em> cultivation is a labour intensive activity and almost all the family members of the household are involved in silkworm rearing, silk reeling and weaving. Unfortunately for the farmers of Dhemaji floods are destroying the basis of this industry.</p>
<p>The district has experienced recurrent floods, on an annual basis for the last few years. The Dhemaji Agriculture Department put the number of farm families affected this year at 50,500. Assam has an average <a href="http://www.jsk.gov.in/dlhs3/assam.pdf">family size of just under 5 people per family</a>, which would mean that almost 250,000 people would have been affected out of a total population of <a href="http://www.census2011.co.in/census/district/147-dhemaji.html">about 700,000.</a> A total of 3,718 hectares of agricultural land was covered in silt this year, pushing the affected people to search alternative livelihood in non-agricultural sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_41" style="width: 1030px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" class="size-full wp-image-41" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg" alt="The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)" width="1020" height="633" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-41" class="wp-caption-text">The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)</p></div>
<p>The floods and siltation have destroyed, or endangered, plantations of the Som plant, on which the <em>Muga</em> silkworms feed. The Som plantations – known as <em>Sumonis</em> – have been gradually destroyed as they have either been displaced, or their roots buried in sandy silt. Kusha Sonowal of Laomuri village, Dhemaji, said that the unavailability of good quality seeds has severely affected indigenous <em>Muga</em> rearing. Abandoning her expertise in weaving, she now helps her family run a small tea stall some 2 kilometres from her home.</p>
<h2><strong>Loss linked to change in temperature and humidity</strong></h2>
<p>Joya Duvarah, who now runs a small shop near the main road in Laomuri village, laments that her family would have earned millions if only their once prosperous <em>Muga</em> cultivation thrived. The chronic havoc of flood brought disaster and they had to cut down hectares of their Som plantations that had rotted after being submerged for months. “Apart from floods that have eaten away our <em>Sumonis</em>, a rise in temperature has brought down the production. The silkworms that are grown outside cannot bear so much heat. Vagaries of weather are responsible for premature death of worms.” she added.</p>
<p>The silkworm needs temperatures of around 30-35 degree Celsius and a humidity level of 80-85% in order to thrive. Dhemaji suffered heavy losses in <em>Muga</em> production in the last couple of years as silkworms died out due to the increase of air temperature and humidity, according to the Sericulture Department of Assam.  The current records show the annual rainfall of the district ranges from 2600 mm to 3200 mm, the relative humidity varies from 90% to 73% while the temperature varies between 39.9C in summer and 5.9C in winter. Changes in temperature and humidity lead to diseases like <a href="http://www.thethirdpole.net/2015/beth.walker/Downloads/Flacherie,%20and%20Grasserie">Flacherie</a>, and Grasserie that can wipe out an entire lot of silkworms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tocklai.net/">Tocklai Experimental Station</a>, the premier body in tea research in the state and the oldest tea research station in the world, has observed that in the last 90 there has been a <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090328/jsp/northeast/story_10728043.jsp">rise in temperature of 1.5C in many areas, and that the rainfall has decreased by 200mm on average</a>, and is now down to <a href="http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/urban/rainfall.htm">2,800mm a year</a>. Climate change compels tea cultivators to use more pesticides to kill pests and mites in their garden. This pesticide contaminates the air, and silkworms die when they breathe in the pesticides used in tea gardens nearby.</p>
<p>Though climate change has been affecting silkworms in Assam, there is no research or planning to save the glorious silk of Assam. Sources at the zonal office of the Central Silk Board in, Guwahati, the state capital, say that the board has not initiated any study on the impacts of climate change on <em>Muga</em> silk production.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixty two-year-old Luciano Mangaeao of Paranora in Beira, Mozambique could not hide his fear.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his hand on a sweltering afternoon and remarked dejectedly: “It’s almost rain season and I know what it means for us. It means a season of suffering; floods and storms are coming again.”</p>
<p>Though he has lived with his family in Paranora on the coast of the Indian Ocean for over three decades, the extreme weather events experienced in Beira over the past decade have left him and other residents at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>Beira, a colonial city that sprouted in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, was originally designed to accommodate 30,000 people, but today it is Mozambique’s second largest city with a population of more than 500,000. The city is a critical gateway to the sea for landlocked countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, but many of the residents live in abject poverty.</p>
<p>Experts say that tropical cyclones build up over the Indian Ocean and send water surging into Beira, inundating residential and poverty-stricken areas, many of which are below sea level. Within hours, the drainage system backs up, evacuation routes are cut off, and fecal material seeps into the fields and the food chain, even contaminating drinking water.</p>
<p>Figures from the Mozambican government reveal that between 1980 and 1993, two category three or higher cyclones hit the country, compared to seven in the period between 1994 and 2007.According to a 2013 report,<em>Assessing the Risk of Cyclone-Induced Storm Surge and Sea-level Rise in Mozambique</em>, wind risks in Beira are much higher than in the capital, Maputo. Maputo is more effectively shielded by the Madagascar land-mass, which also tends to dissipate cyclone energy, so the probability of intense wind events is much higher in Beira.</p>
<div id="attachment_267" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267" class="size-large wp-image-267" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A house in Beira that was destroyed by a tropical cyclone (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-267" class="wp-caption-text">A house in Beira that was destroyed by a tropical cyclone (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>“During the rainy season some parts of Beira experience massive flooding and we are forced to abandon our homes and move to higher areas inland. We lose property worth thousands of dollars each season but because our lives depend on the sea we have no choice but to return after the floods,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>Some buildings have been abandoned for good and are left to slowly crumble. A deserted government building stands close to the sea, so are many others including shops and beer halls. Roads have been also been destroyed.</p>
<p>The crudely built stone, sack and sand sea walls tell a story of poverty as Beira struggles to adapt to climate change-induced calamities. Some of the sea barricades have succumbed to tropical cyclones and storms. Other parts of the barricades are slowly receding into the rising sea water.</p>
<p>The extreme weather events in Beira are beyond the comprehension of many, with some residents convinced that the apocalyptic end is nigh.</p>
<p>“No one is telling us what is happening but from the stories we hear on television the future does not look good for us,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>His fears were shared by Luiza Ferenando, an illiterate middle aged woman who lives in Storire, a neighborhood in the city.</p>
<p>“My life depends on fishing and I can’t leave this place. I have no other opportunities outside this area,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" class="size-large wp-image-266" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg" alt="Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-266" class="wp-caption-text">Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Thirty four-year-old Eduardo Fuinouto has been living in Paranora for sixteen years, selling different wares to the fishermen in Beira.</p>
<p>“When storms come our businesses come to a halt and we move to higher grounds. But our future is here and we hope our mayor will do something to serve our city and our businesses,” Fuinouto said.</p>
<p>Faustino Estacha, a twenty three-year-old university student, also remains optimistic that the mayor of Beirahas bigger plans to save the city.</p>
<p>“One of these plans is to build a sea wall which can save our homes,” he said.</p>
<p>He added: “People have nice homes and they can’t just leave but the barricades which used to be here have been destroyed by the sea water.”</p>
<p>According to Bill McKibben, a U.S.-based climate activist and founder of <em>350.org</em>, some communities facing rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions have no choice but to leave for good.</p>
<p>“Building sea walls is an option, but very expensive. The frustration is that the world seems not care. It’s a very depressing situation and some people (living on coastal areas) have to pack their bags and go,” McKibben said.</p>
<p>In the face of this growing threat, Graca Machel, a human rights activist and member of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders who work together for peace and human rights,urges coastal countries to develop programs to better assist these vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>“Countries on coastal areas should come up with policies on how to protect communities or encourage the people to move a little further from the coast,” Machel said.</p>
<p>The mayor of Beira, Daviz Simango, said more than 100,000 residents living in low lying areas in the city will have to be relocated to higher areas in the next decade.</p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-large wp-image-265" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>He was quick to add that the city needed more than US$100 million to address climate change-induced problems, an amount that he said the city could not raise without the intervention of the private sector.</p>
<p>A Dutch engineering firm, Deltares, is working with other private companies like Witteveen +Bos, Wissing, Niras Mozambique and VandenBroek Consulting to partner with the city of Beira to develop a so-called <em>Beira Master Plan 2035 </em>and avert a full-on climate change disaster.</p>
<p>“Two important initiatives in this respect are: capacity building and institutional strengthening focused on the planning and enforcement capacity of municipality and the establishment of the Beira Land Development Company,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Simango said the Land Development Company, which will be a partnership between the city and private investors, will assist in the implementation of a new finance model where financial feasibility of the Beira Municipality and of the masterplan is increased through several business cases.</p>
<p>“The selling of dredging sand and the selling of land with road and drainage infrastructure are important income generating elements of this finance model,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Deltares senior project manager Peter Letitre said they would establish a land development company through an initial investment of up to US$20 million.</p>
<p>“A reasonable starting budget would be around US$10- $20 million. Planning capacity and financial means need to be mobilized. Besides, a better (win-win) cooperation between City and Port of Beira is very important for the economic growth of the Port and the City”.</p>
<p>According to this ambitious plan, the city needs to stop uncontrolled issuing of land to developers especially in areas which should be designated for water retention.</p>
<p>There is also a need to plan, zone and enforce land reserved for important future infrastructure projects like retention basins, drainage canals, sewage lines and roads. Assessments of the potential vulnerabilities of vital infrastructure – such as power lines, roads and railways – to flooding, and repairs of these weaknesses must also be conducted.</p>
<p>But significant obstacles to the implementation of such plans remain.</p>
<p>Land regulations in Beira are poorly enforced, which contributes to fragmented urban development. Here, speculators purchase property at low prices with the hope of later turning a profit, and are not willing to give it to the government for infrastructure projects. Because there is no incentive for these private developers to work alongside government plans, sustainable development in Beira remains just out of reach.</p>

<p>Letitre said the government must play a critical role in designating and enforcing reserved spaces for important future projects.</p>
<p>“This is a complex process for which cooperation of the inhabitants is very important. Ordinary people (in Beira) are also involved in planning of various projects such as the drainage projects in various neighborhoods, in cooperation with the authorities. They are also involved in operation and maintenance of drainage projects and solid waste projects,” Letitre said.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, Letitre remains bullish on Beira’s future. “After the master plan is successfully implemented,” he said, “Beira will be a safer, more sustainable, prosperous and beautiful city.”</p>
<p>These are hopeful words, but one thing is certain: successful implementation of the Beira Master Plan will require the participation of key stakeholders in the city or risk facing the same fate as similar plans that have come before it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are troubled waters ahead for a Polynesia group of people within the Melanesian country of Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>With more than half a million residents, the Solomon Islands is comprised of mostly dark-skinned Melanesian people with a smaller population of fairer skinned Micronesian and Polynesians.</p>
<p>As many of these minority populations have been swallowed up by the mainstream Melanesian group on the larger islands, the remote Polynesian outliers in the archipelago Ontong Java (commonly referred to as Lord Howe by Solomon Islanders) are also being slowly consumed, but by the sea.</p>
<div id="attachment_556" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Beautiful-as-it-seems-but-not-so-cool-during-king-tides.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-556" class="size-large wp-image-556" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Beautiful-as-it-seems-but-not-so-cool-during-king-tides-1024x576.jpg" alt="Beautiful coastline threatened by rising seas (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Beautiful-as-it-seems-but-not-so-cool-during-king-tides-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Beautiful-as-it-seems-but-not-so-cool-during-king-tides-300x169.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Beautiful-as-it-seems-but-not-so-cool-during-king-tides-1020x574.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-556" class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful coastline threatened by rising seas (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>The Ontong Java group is one of the largest in the world consisting of 120 small, low coral atolls that enclose a vast lagoon extending 70 kilometers from Luaniua in the southeast to Pelau in the north.</p>
<p>Approximately 3,000 people live in both permanent and semi-permanent houses on both islands.</p>
<p>The Lord Howe Settlement in the capital of Honiara is home to some 600 people from Ontong Java Atoll who can only claim ancestral ties to the atoll, but have no permanent home.</p>
<p>These residents are susceptible to sea level rise, tsunami, heat waves and other natural disasters like cyclones. But even more troubles lie ahead for those who could be forced to leave their homes from the natural intrusion of the rising Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Their traditional food sources like swamp taro, potato, coconut and other fruit trees are being threatened by the current El Nino -induced drought. Over-fishing and extraction of sea resources like sea cucumber for commercial use by local residents means sea food and marine lives are also becoming scarce.</p>
<p>Root crops such as swamp taro are dying due to salt-water infiltrating into the land, which is no more than three meters above sea level.</p>

<p>Their strong attachment to the land, sea, family and culture could be destroyed by the very ocean they depended on for thousands of years, as well as from normal occurrences such as tropical cyclones on this remote part of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Government intervention so far has been through the subsidization of shipping costs for basic food items like rice, biscuits, sugar and needed fuel for fishing boat engines.</p>
<p>On the regional level, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) initiated the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) project, mainly focused on exploring food security for the Ontong Javans.</p>
<h2>Canary in the coal mine</h2>
<p>In many ways, atoll residents are the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the Soloman Islands archipelago when it comes to natural disasters. They are the first to be affected by the rising threats of climate change.</p>
<p>Adaptation measures under PACC such as new methods of farming and packaging of local food sources have received some coverage, but it’s the question of ‘relocation’ that has dominated mainstream discourses on a national and regional level. The Ontong Java Atoll and other low-lying islands in the Pacific Ocean such as Tuvalu and Kiribati face common threats from climate-induced impacts on their environment and livelihoods.</p>
<div id="attachment_562" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_tropical_cyclones_pose_risk_to_the_residents_.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-562" class="size-large wp-image-562" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_tropical_cyclones_pose_risk_to_the_residents_-1024x647.jpg" alt="Tropical cyclones pose risks to residents (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_tropical_cyclones_pose_risk_to_the_residents_-1024x647.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_tropical_cyclones_pose_risk_to_the_residents_-300x189.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_tropical_cyclones_pose_risk_to_the_residents_-1020x644.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-562" class="wp-caption-text">Tropical cyclones pose risks to residents (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>Work is underway on a national climate change policy, according to Dr. Melchoir Mataki, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Disaster Management and Meteorology (MECDM). “The current government made it a priority for us to develop a climate change legislation,” he said. “Preparatory work on the draft legislation has been completed and this will be further advanced in 2016.”</p>
<p>Mataki acknowledged that the issue of relocation is often perceived as a last option, but for many parts of the country it’s becoming the only “reasonable” option left. “[It] cannot be postponed any longer,” he said,” however relocation is a sensitive and delicate matter because it touches a variety of contentious issues such as land tenure and finance.”</p>
<p>“[It’s] not only about the physical relocation of people and their properties,” Mataki added, “but also entails political, social, economic and cultural shifts and losses for people who will move and those who will receive them.” For these reasons, he said the government is focusing on identifying the country’s most vulnerable populations in order to come up with appropriate relocation guidelines. Responsibility for this task has fallen to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey (MLH&amp;S).</p>
<p>Relocation may be the only solution for the people of Ontong Java Atoll in the near future, but it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Scott Leckie who currently serves as the director of Displacement Solutions, a Geneva-based NGO working to assist people who are displaced from their homes due to conflict or climate change shared similar sentiments.</p>
<div id="attachment_563" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-563" class="size-large wp-image-563" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1024x579.jpg" alt="The beautiful coast is slowly eroding (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="430" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-300x170.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-672x380.jpg 672w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1020x577.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-563" class="wp-caption-text">The beautiful coast is slowly eroding (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>“Our position is essentially that no one should ever be forced to move from their traditional homes and land,” he said,” and that if planned relocation is contemplated, that this must be voluntary and wholly-driven by the people themselves, supported by a large majority of those to relocate, and be relocated to a place of the community&#8217;s choosing.”</p>
<p>Leckie, who was born in Los Angeles with Netherlands citizenship and currently resides in Australia said planned relocation processes should be guided by the Peninsula Principles on Climate Displacement Within States (2013) and appropriate, detailed and adequately funded planning must precede any actual movement of people.</p>
<p>“As with all citizens from Ontong Java, the people of the atoll have rights and any relocation must be a right-based approach which respects, preserves and improves their human rights in the process,” he said.</p>
<p>Some residents have gone on record to say that is relocation becomes necessary, they would choose to move to Isabel Province, which is larger than the province under which they are currently governed as part of the Malaita Outer Islands (MOI).</p>
<p>In such cases, Leckie said that intensive work should be done with host communities near the relocation site to ensure a smooth transition. “A successful of relocation is extremely difficult, but it can work if all parties work together to make it work,” he noted.</p>
<p>His firm, Displacement Solutions, has experience on the ground in Ontong Java. Their photojournalist Beni Knight spend two months on the atoll this year documenting the ongoing challenges faced by residents. Relocation, Leckie said, appears all but certain. “Land is eroding fast, some villages have already disappeared, crops are ever more difficult to grow,” he said. “If relocation is the option the people of Ontong Java choose, this will be particularly difficult for older people, many of whom will not want to leave and who may have never or very rarely ever left the atoll before.”</p>
<div id="attachment_561" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-561" class="size-large wp-image-561" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1024x643.jpg" alt="A section of the atoll's coastline (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="477" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1024x643.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-300x188.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1020x641.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-561" class="wp-caption-text">A section of the atoll&#8217;s coastline (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>When it comes to climate displacement, experts say that people face a difficult choice: stay and adapt, move as a community in a planned manner, or migrate on a person by person or family by family basis. “We generally favor relocation over migration as it is organized, well thought-out, and planned,” Leckie said. “It has the best chance of preserving the unique cultures that so many people of the islands live with and cherish so much.”</p>
<p>Equally vulnerable are Ontong Javans residing in the heart of capital Honiara in the Lord Howe Settlement. The Settlement is located beside the river and coast of Mataniko River delta.</p>
<p>A United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment in 2014 noted the Settlement has an area of 2.8 hectares with a population of 631–295 men and 336 women. According to the report, there is a population density of 223 persons per hectare, “the highest among the hotspots studied…packed with houses spaced closely together.”</p>
<p>Doctorate student Coggan Kuare, who left the Solomon Islands to study at Hokkaido University in Japan, said the Settlement itself needs relocating as the devastating floods of April 2014 which killed more than 20 people indicate that climate change poses great risk to the settlers.</p>
<p>“Flooding from Mataniko River, sea level rise and tsunami are the greatest threats to the Ontong Java settlers of Lord Howe Settlement,” said Kuare whose is working on the thesis “Disposition, Expansion and Relocation of Honiara City.”</p>
<h2>Hoping for change</h2>
<p>With world leaders gathered in Paris for the United Nations (UN) climate negotations, the plight of Ontong Javans both on the atoll and Lord Howe Settlement cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>This year Reverend Nigel Kelaepa, a prominent Ontong Javan is observing the negotiations in Paris. It’s his first time at such a high level climate event.</p>
<p>The issue of relocation may appear insignificant to some, but reducing global greenhouse gas emissions could save the Ontong Javans from the rising sea level. Led by Samuel Manetoali from the Minister of Environment, Climate Change and Disaster and Meteorology (MECDM), the Solomon Islands delegation to Paris has joined other small island states to lobby for the reduction of the global greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>“We want an ambitious and legally binding agreement within the context of the UNFCCC that obliges major emitters to reduce their emissions to restrain global temperature change to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius, treats loss and damage as a distinct element of the agreement separate from adaptation, recognizes the special case of the most vulnerable parties such as the Solomon Islands, and fast tracks financial and technical resources in the most transparent, accessible and ‘non-loan’ modalities to meet our adaptation and mitigation needs,” said Dr. Mataki, MECDM’s Permanent Secretary.</p>
<p>In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted to the UNFCCC, the Solomon Islands pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12% below 2015 levels by 2025 and 30% below 2015 levels by 2030. With international assistance, the Solomon Islands can reduce its emissions by more than 50% by 2050, but Mataki said the pledges of major emitters have fallen short. “Global action to address climate change must not leave anyone behind,” he said, “it must be inclusive as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Politics aside, the people of Ontong Java bear little responsibility for the rising seas, but residents are looking to world leaders to address the root causes of their plight before their island home disappears under their feet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amount of water is incomprehensible. We’ve been flying for hours, and just when we’re about as far from a landmass as you can possibly get—a spot where the curving, wave-flecked Pacific Ocean stretches thousands of kilometers in every direction—an island slides into view. It’s no more than a snippet of sand and palm trees, a snake winding through the blue plain of the Pacific. Fanning out around it are 1,200 similar islands, some inhabited, others not, arranged into a constellation of 29 atolls like stars in a universe of ocean. For every square kilometer of land in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, there are 10,732 square kilometers of ocean.</p>
<p>Roughly 2,000 years ago, voyagers sailing outrigger canoes discovered these smudges of land, and their descendants stayed, becoming the best navigators in the Pacific. While other cultures relied largely on the stars to find their way, Marshallese supplemented their astrological knowledge with an intricate understanding of wave dynamics and ocean currents. Boys floated on their backs for hours, memorizing the patterns beneath them. Later, far from home, they determined their location simply by the motion of the waves.</p>
<div id="attachment_144" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144" class="size-large wp-image-144" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-1024x825.jpg" alt="An aerial view of Majuro, the capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Credit: Krista Langlois)" width="760" height="612" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-1024x825.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-300x242.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-993x800.jpg 993w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-144" class="wp-caption-text">An aerial view of Majuro, the capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Credit: Krista Langlois)</p></div>
<p>Even on land, Marshallese life is defined by the ocean. Since few plants grow in the sandy soil, the majority of food is harvested offshore; Marshallese contains 50 different words and phrases for fishing techniques. The foods that do come from land—breadfruit, taro, the fruit of the spiky pandanus plant—are often fermented or preserved for seafaring journeys. Even the language is born of the sea: instead of using “right” and “left” to give directions on land, the islanders use “ocean-side” (the outer edge of the atoll) and “lagoon-side” (the protected interior).</p>
<p>For generations, Marshallese called their home Aelõñ Kein Ad—“these islands of ours.” A few ships passed by, but the islands’ culture evolved in relative isolation until 1857, when the first wave of outsiders arrived: Christian missionaries bearing clothing, disease, and religion.</p>
<p>By the Second World War, Japan had taken over the islands to use as a strategic base. The outer islands were bombed by Allied forces for 75 days. Blood seeped into the sand. And when the war was over and the islands ceded to US control, nuclear testing began. Between 1946 and 1958, the United States detonated 67 atomic bombs on the Marshall Islands—the equivalent power of 1.6 Hiroshimas a day for 12 years straight. Islands were permanently despoiled and entire communities forced into exile on other, less livable, islands. Cancer rates increased, and miscarriages and previously unknown birth defects became common.</p>
<p>Through all of this, Marshallese culture adapted and survived. But today, it’s facing the one battle that might be impossible to win. Climate experts predict that because of rising sea levels caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the Marshall Islands could be uninhabitable by the end of this century.</p>
<p>As the ocean seeps into homes and buckles roads, it’s shifting from a source of inspiration to one of fear. Some Marshallese have already started to plan for relocation. Yet unlike other climate refugees—people from the island nation of Kiribati buying backup land in Fiji, for example, or the family from Tuvalu seeking climate refugee status in New Zealand—the Marshallese know exactly where they’ll go. An agreement that came into force when the Marshall Islands gained independence in 1986 allows any citizen to live and work in the United States indefinitely, without a visa or green card.</p>

<p>By the year 2100, it’s conceivable that climate change will force the entire population of the Marshall Islands to US shores. Already, more than 25,000 Marshallese—over a third of the population—have left the islands, many in the last 15 years. Among them was Sarah Joseph, now 22 and a resident of Enid, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Like Sarah, a surprising number of Marshallese migrants wind up landlocked in rural America, far from the ocean that’s shaped every aspect of their culture. Which raises the question: can Marshallese traditions and language survive without the sea? Or, in the words of the Marshallese minister of foreign affairs Tony deBrum, will climate change amount to cultural genocide?</p>

<p>In 2006, I arrived on the remote Marshallese atoll of Ebon to teach English for a year. Sarah was the oldest daughter of the family I lived with, and one of my eighth grade students. She was smart and spunky, with a wide grin and dark hair in a floppy bun atop her head.</p>
<p>There’s no telephone or electricity on Ebon, and only one store offering rice, flour, Kool-Aid, and Spam. But sometimes, when even the one road running the length of the island began to feel too crowded, Sarah would take a boat across the 100-square-kilometer lagoon to a tiny island called Demdol, where her grandfather lived alone in a one-room shack. She’d stay for weeks, on a patch of sand no bigger than a football field, reading a Marshallese Bible, scrubbing laundry on a washboard, and collecting eggs from the chickens that pecked beneath the palms.</p>
<p>When I first met Sarah, she had just returned from Demdol. It was late August, and the days were unbearably hot. But evenings—when the sun slipped over the edge of the lagoon and the breeze rustled the palms and a string of coconut-shell fires glowed like jewels along a ribbon of land—evenings were everything I imagined living on a Pacific island would be. Sometimes Sarah would lounge in the hammock behind her parents’ house, strumming a beat-up ukulele and watching as the darkening lagoon mirrored the star-choked sky until the difference between the two became indistinguishable. It was as if we were sitting in a bowl of stars. As her mother, Rakki, stoked the fire, Sarah’s father, Jola—having spent the day cracking coconuts, drying the meat in the sun, and packing it into burlap sacks to sell for just a few dimes per kilogram—would slide his wooden skiff into the lagoon to fish.</p>
<p>Most nights, we’d already be asleep by the time Jola returned with the next day’s protein. But occasionally, if a child in the village was turning one, Sarah, Rakki, and I would join a handful of other women and walk by moonlight to the mother’s hut to sing to the child.</p>
<p>In the Marshall Islands, a first birthday is a significant milestone, and its celebration—which is much bigger than a wedding or funeral—is a remnant of the time when infant mortality was high.</p>
<p>The event begins at midnight, with a chorus of women singing to the child, and concludes days later with a traditional feast attended by the whole village. On outer islands like Ebon, the food is often served in baskets woven from palm fronds, piled with fried donuts, balls of rice, sea turtle, fish, pork, taro, breadfruit, pandanus, and more. Instead of bringing a gift, attendees take something from the host family—a pair of sandals, perhaps, or a frypan—and carry it home. The less the host family is left with, the greater their generosity. It’s a testament to the strength of the Marshallese community, an understanding that no matter how little you have, you’ll be cared for.</p>
<p>This was the world Sarah lived in for the first 14 years of her life. Looking back, it was paradise.</p>

<p>But opportunities on Ebon are few, and the school only goes to eighth grade. Students from outer islands who pass a national exam and want to go to high school have to leave home, often staying in dormitories or with relatives in Majuro, the islands’ capital. Many never return. From 2006 to 2011, 17 of 26 outer islands experienced dramatic population loss, while Majuro’s population increased by 1,770, to about 28,000.</p>
<p>Yet although Majuro offers education and jobs not available on outer islands, life there presents its own set of challenges. The reefs have been overfished or damaged by development—Majuro residents eat an average of 71.5 kilograms of fish per year, compared to 147 kilograms on the outer islands. Processed, imported foods make up the difference, but they cost money, and there isn’t enough paid work to go around. On any given afternoon, countless young men lean against buildings or lie on cool cement floors, smoking cigarettes and passing time. Each year, hundreds of Marshallese leave the outer islands for Majuro, and, each year, hundreds more leave Majuro for the United States.</p>
<p>Sarah was among the few who would have been content to stay on Ebon. She dislikes cities and crowds of people. She likes swimming in the translucent turquoise lagoon and singing on Sundays at the little blue-and-white Protestant church on the edge of the sea. But Rakki and Jola wanted more for her. By the time Sarah graduated from eighth grade, seven out of Rakki’s nine siblings lived in the Unites States. One day, the family got word that a sister would buy Sarah a one-way ticket to “Amedka.”</p>
<p>It was late spring, 2008. Sarah sat at the edge of Ebon’s narrow landing strip, wedged between the lagoon and the ocean. She watched for the white speck of an airplane to materialize in the blinding blue sky. She tried not to cry.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like most Marshallese in the United States, Sarah didn’t move because of climate change. She moved because of a lack of opportunities, and because her family said it was best. Back then, in 2008, climate change was still a phrase that few people in the Marshall Islands had heard.</p>
<p>But Sarah’s timing couldn’t have been better. That December, the highest tides of the year coalesced with a massive storm, and three-meter waves swamped the Marshall Islands. Staple crops like taro and breadfruit were ruined, roads and seawalls washed out, and knee-high seawater surged into people’s homes. Graveyards flooded and tombs were destroyed.</p>
<p>As with the world’s other low-lying atoll nations, Kiribati and the Maldives, the Marshall Islands have always been susceptible to floods and typhoons. Archaeologist Marshall Weisler calls low coral atolls “the most precarious landscapes for human habitation,” bar none. One flood in 1979 became so legendary in the Marshall Islands that elders told and retold stories of the ocean coming into their homes while they slept, waves battering their walls. The 2008 flood was intense, but many wrote it off as a similar freak event, the kind of natural disaster that visits the region every few decades.</p>
<p>Except that the following year, in 2009, it happened again. And again. “Inundation events,” as they’re now euphemistically known, are no longer once-in-a-lifetime occasions. For the past few years, they’ve swamped vulnerable neighborhoods at least biannually and sometimes even more frequently, usually during the highest tides of the year. Sea levels in the western Pacific have risen by an estimated five centimeters per decade since the 1950s, and rainfall in Majuro has decreased by over a centimeter per decade. Droughts have become more frequent, too. The lack of rainwater—which people depend on to fill drinking water catchments and irrigate crops—is almost as troubling as rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Mark Stege, executive director of the Marshall Islands Conservation Society at the College of the Marshall Islands, explains that alone, the Marshallese could withstand any one of these events. But stacked atop one another, there’s a threshold: a point at which people decide that the risk of property damage, the health and safety of their children, and the stress of living in fear, overpower the desire to stay on land that’s been handed down for generations, with their family and culture intact.</p>
<p>Stege is creating models to determine where, exactly, that threshold lies. How much flood risk is too much? How many floods per year are too many? Though he hasn’t yet come up with an answer, he feels certain there will come a time when the Marshall Islands are no longer habitable. There won’t be a sudden exodus, a single moment, but over years or even decades, people will reach their personal threshold and leave.</p>

<p>No one I spoke to knows anyone who’s yet left the country because of climate change. But the country’s first climate refugees may not be far off. When the US government bombed the Marshallese island of Bikini in the 1940s and 1950s—in the name of nuclear testing—the people who lived there were given a trust fund to help them relocate. Most were forced onto the barren island of Kili, one of the few spots in the Marshall Islands without a lagoon, a feature that buffers islands from the crashing waves. Because of this inadequacy, the island is particularly vulnerable to flooding, so Bikinians are petitioning the US Congress to use the trust fund to buy land in the United States. The fund set up to help them survive nuclear testing may now help them survive climate change instead.</p>
<p>Yet the government refuses to consider a similar solution for the entire country. Doing so is akin to admitting defeat, and the Marshallese aren’t ready for that. Not yet. Undeterred, Minister deBrum travels the world, telling leaders and politicians that climate change can be reversed, that reducing greenhouse emissions can save the Marshall Islands from becoming a country of abandoned buildings being slowly devoured by salt and coconut crabs.</p>
<p>Instead of seeking asylum, the Marshallese are embracing their heritage, clinging to the essence of what makes them islanders. Traditional tattoo designs mimicking the patterns of fish scales and ocean waves have become popular after decades of disuse. A program called <em>Jaki-ed </em>is reviving the art of weaving fine clothing mats from pandanus leaves. Stege is creating a digital Noah’s Ark, a record of plants and fish whose names could be lost. And more than 300 teens and young adults have graduated from a program called <em>Waan Ael</em><em>õñ</em> <em>in Majel</em> that teaches them to build and sail dugout outrigger canoes. The program’s director, Alson Kelen, sailed one more than 3,800 kilometers, from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands, using only traditional navigation. A storm chased him for the entire three-week journey.</p>
<p>But while cultural preservation and calls for climate action are vital to maintaining Marshall Islanders’ sense of identity, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves little hope that such measures will be more than stopgaps. Mary-Elena Carr, a biological oceanographer with Columbia University, explains that even if carbon emissions stopped tomorrow, the lengthy lifespan of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that warming trends will continue unabated for the next 1,000 years. The official IPCC estimate is that global sea levels will rise between 26 and 98 centimeters by 2100, and Carr thinks even that is conservative. “I find it extremely unlikely that global average sea level rise will be below one meter by 2100,” she says. Either way, much of the Marshall Islands will be submerged.</p>

<p>From his office in downtown Majuro, which features a floor-to-ceiling photograph of an atomic bomb exploding over Bikini, Bikini’s acting mayor Wilson Note says that he knows not everyone agrees with his peoples’ decision to prepare for exodus. But Bikinians were already robbed of their homeland once. Moving to the United States won’t be much of a stretch. “Kili is dangerous now,” Note says. “Big waves come and wash over the island. We are very proud because we are the very first in the Marshall Islands to think about moving out of the Marshall Islands. We are the leaders.”</p>
<p>When I ask where they might go, he shrugs. “Maybe Hawaii. Maybe Oklahoma.”</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s a sea surrounding Oklahoma, too, but instead of a wave-flecked plain of blue, it’s a sea of farmland, a grid of fields punctuated by grain silos and pump jacks. One in five jobs in Oklahoma is supported—directly or indirectly—by the oil and natural gas industries, and as of last year, roughly 55 percent of adults in Enid, Oklahoma believed global warming is real. The national average is 63 percent.</p>
<p>Oklahoma is also the fifth most popular state for Marshallese migrants (after Arkansas, Hawaii, Washington, and California), and it’s where Sarah moved after living with her aunt for six years in Arkansas and graduating from high school there. Though Enid seems like an improbable place for Pacific Islanders to settle, it is, in a way, familiar. The first Marshallese came here with missionaries about 40 years ago, and wrote home about the jobs that could be had in meat-processing factories, and the public schools their children could attend. Eventually, family joined family.</p>
<p>I went to Enid to trace Sarah’s journey, and after settling into a sketchy motel between the Korean Church of Grace and the Wild Childs Gentlemen’s Club, I visited Enid High School, where Sarah’s cousin Ashlyn Joash works as a liaison between the school district and the Marshallese community. Ashlyn translates teachers’ notes for Marshallese parents who don’t speak English, and explains to teachers why their Marshallese students struggle with punctuality and grades. Her hope, she says, is to help Oklahomans understand who the islanders in their midst are and where they came from. (Case in point, when I told Enid High principal Jim Beierschmitt, who oversees 150 Marshallese students, out of 1,810, that I’d recently been to Majuro, he asked, “Now, where’s that?”)</p>
<p>Five years ago, the Marshallese population in Enid was 1,000. Today, it may be as high as 2,000, and is expected to double again in 10 years. Yet, though Marshallese are legal workers who gladly take undesirable, low-paying jobs, Enid hasn’t exactly welcomed them. “It’s a redneck state and we have a bad name here,” Ashlyn says later. “You hear a lot of ‘Go back where you came from, go back to the Marshall Islands!’” (Ashlyn was born and raised in Oklahoma.)</p>

<p>In 2009, Oklahoma passed legislation that English would be the only language option for driving tests. Federal social benefits such as health insurance are unavailable to Marshallese migrants who aren’t citizens. Terry Mote, Micronesian community health coordinator for the Garfield County Health Department, told me his elderly mother caught pneumonia and was hospitalized soon after he brought her to Oklahoma. Without Medicare, her bill came to $10,000. He worked two jobs to pay it off.</p>
<p>But there are also signs that things are improving. One teacher, Rita Hartwick, traveled to the Marshall Islands to learn basic weaving and cooking, and is now bringing that knowledge to her home economics classes. And after English as a Second Language teacher Jennifer Patterson noticed that Marshallese students—even with the ubiquitous skinny jeans and smartphones of American high schools—still strolled between classes strumming ukuleles and Skyped their families in Majuro to sing for children’s first birthdays, she organized a Marshallese choir to “highlight all the positive things they do.” The choir has already sung for the president of the Marshall Islands when he visited, and has been invited to sing at the Oklahoma governor’s office this Christmas. The morning I’m there, they sing their national anthem to me in Marshallese:</p>
<p>“My island lies o’er the ocean / Like a wreath of flowers upon the sea…” Their voices rise and swell. If I close my eyes, the fluorescent-lit room becomes my classroom in Ebon, humid, the salty smell of the ocean drifting through open windows. “I’ll never leave my dear home sweet home / God of our forefathers, protect and bless forever the Marshall Islands!”</p>
<p>Later, some of the students in the choir tell me they’re Bikinian and that their parents, already displaced by nuclear testing, were among the first immigrants to Enid. Because many have been unable to save enough for the $2,000 plane ticket back to Majuro, their children have never seen the ocean. When I mention I’ve been to the Marshall Islands some of the students ask, in awe, “Did you swim in the ocean? What was it like?”</p>
<hr />
<p>That Sunday, I see some of the same teenagers at the Marshallese First Assembly of God, singing Marshallese hymns and dancing beneath palm-frond weavings that look like sea turtles and the swirls of waves. After the service, there’s a party, but the only seafood to serve the guests of honor is some sort of fried fish brought in a cooler from Oklahoma City. So the pastor’s two adult granddaughters grab $40 from the collection plate, and I drive them down the road to an all-you-can-eat Asian buffet. There, the two Marshallese women, their tropical-colored muumuus standing out in a crowd of Midwestern farmers and roughnecks, fill take-out containers with steamed mussels. We joke sadly that this is fishing in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Sarah moved from Arkansas to Enid in 2013 when she got a scholarship to attend a community college. She lived with her cousin Ashlyn’s family in a crowded, dingy apartment on the west side of town. She wanted to study criminal justice. But one semester in, when she was 20, Sarah found herself pregnant.</p>
<p>Carrying a child revived the debilitating homesickness she’d experienced in those first years away from Ebon. She missed the ocean more than ever, the smell of the coconut oil women rub into their hair, the wind in the palm trees, the cook fires burning in the night. She craved the fish Jola would bring home on a strand of fishing line, the pickled papaya Rakki made. Some weeks, the only thing in Oklahoma Sarah could stomach were chocolate shakes from McDonald’s. One day she drank 12.</p>
<p>And then, on October 2, 2014, Sarah gave birth to a daughter, Marla Armonie Moana Lanwi. Like most Marshallese women, she didn’t cry out once while in labor.</p>
<p>Sarah and her boyfriend, Nimo, who grew up in Majuro, were determined that Marla would celebrate her first birthday in the Marshall Islands. Nimo worked overtime at a meat-processing plant in Enid for a year to save enough for two round-trip tickets. So in March, when Marla was six months old, Sarah carried her onto a plane bound for the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<div id="attachment_147" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA051246.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147" class="size-large wp-image-147" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA051246-1024x768.jpg" alt="Sarah holds her daughter, Marla Armoine Moana Lanwi.

<p>When they were almost as far away from a landmass as you can possibly get, Sarah held her daughter to the airplane window so she could see, improbably, a ribbon of sand and palm trees snaking through the ocean: Aelõñ Kein Ad. These islands of ours.</p>
<p>“Tell them,” writes Marshallese poet Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner. “Tell them that we are nothing without our islands.”</p>
<p>Sarah is not a poet. She’s not a climate advocate. She’s an average Marshallese woman doing her best to help her daughter understand that she is descended from the greatest seafarers the world has ever known. But later this year, after six months in the Marshall Islands, Marla—like so many Marshallese—will leave. By the time the next king tides beat against the flimsy seawalls and wash into people’s homes, she’ll be back in Oklahoma. Unlike many Marshallese-Americans of her generation, though, Marla will later be able to say that once, she knew the ocean. She sat on her mother’s lap at the edge of the lagoon and felt the tropical water tickle her legs. She took her first steps in her paternal grandparents’ gecko-green house that rises from the sea on a piece of land sprouted from oil drums and old tires. She looked into the eyes of the sea turtle that the men speared for her first birthday feast. And, the night before her first birthday, just before midnight, she watched quietly, her brown eyes wide, as a chorus of women and children streamed into the house strumming ukuleles and singing, welcoming her to the world. To her home.</p>

<p><em>Climate change is affecting people across the planet, however, it disproportionately impacts women, particularly those living in poor countries who are traditionally tasked with gathering food, water and fuel for the family. </em></p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>As climate change dries up streams and lakes, women are walking longer distances to fetch water, firewood and other domestic necessities that are vital for every day life. Farming, an activity often carried out by women in African societies, has also been affected.</p>
<p>Under searing temperatures and reduced rainfall, crops are smaller and sometimes do not grow at all. In many of these traditionally patriarchal societies, women have little influence over social and political issues. This is especially the case in northern Malawi, where women are often constrained by laws and cultural norms that limit their economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Though communities here depend on this agricultural production for both income and food, women&#8217;s access to land and ownership of land is heavily restricted. In the northern region districts of Karonga and Mzimba, for example, women are generally not allowed to own enough land for large-scale agricultural production that could promote their economic independence. Instead productive land is primarily controlled by male family members.</p>
<p>But as crops continue to struggle under the effects of climate, many women farmers have begun to lead in the practice of something known as conservation agriculture. This technology enables growers to yield much more from small pockets of land, despite warmer temperatures and erratic rains. It is, however, labor intensive and requires long hours that are often difficult to meet under the pressures of other gender-related roles.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6DEk8aw07ng" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“I always wake up early in the morning searching for food for my children and I don’t find time to concentrate in the garden let alone to take part in the new ways of farming. I am aware of conservation agriculture and I know women who take part, but it’s difficult and so involving I can’t do it alone,&#8221; said Jenipher Tchongwe, who is a mother of four. She added that if she had a husband to take care of some of the family’s needs, she would have taken part in conservation agriculture.</p>
<p>Some women have started growing crops that don’t need much water, such as hybrid maize instead of local varieties They are also using manure, soil and water management, pit growing, soil cover and minimum tillage among other methods.Despite being a widow with seven children, Jessica Kaluwa, is a farmer who is leading in the practice of conservation agriculture. She began to experiment with these methods in 2012 to see if they would work.</p>
<p>“I saw others around my area doing it. I then told myself to give it a try and it really worked for me,” Kaluwa said. She added that since conservation agriculture requires so much time, one must commit. “As a woman, it’s a challenge to concentrate since there are so many other duties I have to fulfill since I have no husband to take up other challenges,&#8221; she added. But she was quick to point out that women could make more of an impact in the agricultural sector if only they had the same land ownership rights as men.</p>
<p>Winnie Ngulube is a mother of four, who is taking part in irrigation farming. She manages to harvest twice a year and she gets all her financial needs from the activity.</p>
<p>“Irrigation farming is another way of farming which Malawians need to focus on. I have managed to raise my kids alone through this way of farming. I harvest twice a year crops like maize, sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes and I mostly sell the produce,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One advocate for women&#8217;s land rights is Chief Kyungu, a prominent leader in Karonga who is working hard to change views on land ownership. Kyungu mandated that under his jurisdiction, women could inherit their husbands’ lands.</p>
<p>“Land distribution culturally favors men since it is believed that they are bread winners. People forget that women are more responsible when it comes to family matters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are taking advantage of the current gender sensitization to change people’s mindsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security has been working on leveling the playing field for both men and women by taking legal action against those who refuse to pass land to women land through the introduction of property grabbing laws. These laws are designed to protect women, but are often subverted due to fear and intimidation in rural regions.</p>
<p>The Malawian government has also introduced so-called &#8220;50:50 campaigns&#8221; where all farmers, male or female, are given the same opportunity in taking farming roles and sponsorship. Gordon Yiwombe from the Ministry of Agriculture emphasized that things are now changing in order to help women farmers overcome long-held restrictions to land ownership.</p>
<p>“In my experience in the field of agriculture and gender,&#8221; said Yiwombe, who works as the principal gender roles and extension support services officer for the ministry, &#8220;I have observed that women farmers produce more than men if they are given the same support despite facing challenges connected to gender roles.&#8221;</p>

<div class="itemFullText">Evidence on the ground shows that women are feeding Malawi despite the challenges of traditional societal roles and gender-based restrictions. Despite this progress, women remain vulnerable to rigid societal roles, which limits their ability to practice climate-resilient agriculture. Without these important changes, it will become more difficult for them to produce enough food to feed their families.</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">If Malawi wants to seek solutions to changing climatic conditions, it should empower its women to lead the way.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The rains didn’t start until June this year,” says Laadi Danladi, clutching water leaves in her hands as she peered across her fields. “By June or July, we should have started harvesting and eating. But now things have changed.” Danladi, a member of Nigeria’s Gbagyi indigenous group, has been farming for four years, but like other rural women employed in the country’s agricultural sector, she faces growing threats from warming temperatures and erratic rainfall.</p>
<p>Across Africa, climate change is having a major impact on agricultural production and food security, but in rural Nigeria where women make up over 60% of the sector, its disrupting livelihoods and traditional practices.</p>
<div id="attachment_534" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-image-534 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png" alt="LAADI DANLADI" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-caption-text">Gbagyi farmer Laadi Danladi says the weather patters are changing. &#8220;By June or July we should have started harvesting and eating, but now things have changed.&#8221; (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>The Gbagyi nation is an ethnic group found in north-central Nigeria. According to National Population Census figures, there is an estimated population of 5.8 million spread across four states: Kaduna, Nassarawa, Niger, Kwara as well as Abuja, the federal capital. They are traditionally farmers, hunters and craftsmen.</p>
<p>Women play a significant role in Gbagyi society and are typically responsible for about 70% of household food production, as well as child rearing, but they remain a marginalized group in Nigeria as they attempt to adapt to the changing climate.</p>
<h2><strong>Unpredictable rain, unreliable harvest<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The Gbgayi women primarily practice subsistence agriculture, which means that they produce enough to feed themselves and their families. Warming temperatures and changes to the yearly rain cycle, however, are disrupting these customary methods. Typically the rainy season starts in spring, but each year seems to bring a later start and inconsistent rainfall for crops.</p>
<p>Like Danladi, 25-year-old bean farmer Godiah Williams is also a member of Nigeria’s Gbagyi minority. She says the unsteady, unpredictable weather patterns have caused the farmers financial ruin.</p>
<p>“We need the government to come and help us with money and fertilizer, so we can farm well, and send our children to school.”</p>
<div id="attachment_542" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" class="size-large wp-image-542" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-768x1024.jpg" alt="A Gbagyi woman working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="760" height="1013" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-225x300.jpg 225w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-542" class="wp-caption-text">A Gbagyi woman working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>In some cases, it’s not just the lack of rain that’s causing problems for Gbgayi farmers.</p>
<p>“Last year, the rains came late and the volume was too much. Many of our crops including guinea corn and even yams did not turn out well. They came out small and spoilt,” laments Salamatu, a Gbagyi farmer in Lugbe, a satellite town outside the federal capital, Abuja.</p>
<p>Many women in this region blame the climactic shift on the actions of a higher power and say they are praying to God to help them through the crisis. For others, like yam farmer Kande James, they are not even sure it exists and blame bad weather as a sort of punishment for bad habits.</p>
<p>“It’s only you educated people that talk about climate change,” says James. “We inflict this situation on ourselves. When people steal from farms where they have not planted, what do you expect; we are the ones bringing it upon ourselves.”</p>
<div id="attachment_538" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-538" class="size-full wp-image-538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png" alt="Kande James says she isn't sure climate change exists (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-538" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;We inflict this situation on ourselves,&#8221; says Kande James when talking about the changing weather patterns  (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>John Baaki, a programme officer with the Abuja-based Women Environmental Programme, has worked with rural women in north-central Nigeria and says greater access to information and data is key to overcoming climactic challenges.</p>
<p>“In order to save them the stress of predicting wrongly, it’s better to rely on the information given by the meteorological agency,” he says. “We always advocate that NIMET (the Nigerian Meteorological Agency) should partner closely with the media.”</p>
<h2><strong>Conditions driving conflict<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>It’s not just the weather patterns affecting the harvest of Nigeria’s Gbagyi farmers. Herdsmen from the country’s hard-hit northern fringes are slowly pushing south, creating greater competition for land, as reduced rainfall leaves little for their cattle to eat. With increased land scarcity and limited agronomical potential, unprecedented conflicts have erupted between local farmers and nomadic herdsmen.</p>
<p>In the Lugbe area of Abuja, herdsmen can be seen moving across the land in search of pasture. While each refused to speak to us, the farmers said they are responsible for the chronic destruction and theft of crops. Kande James says that virtually all the yams she planted that season had been stolen. They had not even matured.</p>
<p>Priscilla Achakpa, the Director of the Women Environmental Programme, says that migrating herdsmen should return to grazing routes and reserves that were proposed by the Nigerian government, a policy which has not been enforced over the years. But she acknowledges that efforts to implement adaptation strategies have been poor and often lack local context. “Most of the time,” she says, “politicians and policies that are being made ignore the indigenous knowledge of these women.”</p>
<h2>Searching for solutions</h2>
<p>As the popular saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. In circumstances of vulnerability, poverty and limited resources, many Gbagyi women have attempted to mitigate the effects of changing weather patterns on their harvests. One farmer, Patience Daniel, cut tree branches to cover her yams and prevent them from dying before the rains came. But these basic innovations are often inadequate and do little to keep crops from withering on the vine.</p>
<div id="attachment_539" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539" class="size-full wp-image-539" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png" alt="Kande James working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-539" class="wp-caption-text">Kande James working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>Kande James took these efforts a bit further by seeking out more dry climate-resistant crops. “[One] species of yam that grows well is the makakusa and that’s the one I have planted,” she says.</p>
<p>Corn farmer Salamatu also revealed that she was experimenting with new types of crops to combat warmer temperatures. “Agric maize (genetically modified maize) dries easily,” she says, “but our native species can withstand the heat.”</p>
<p>In a bid to ensure food security, Nigeria’s Ministry of Environment has initiated programmes that are aimed at simplifying climatic information for rural farmers – particularly women. They hope these efforts will enable them make informed decisions and safeguard their livelihoods.</p>
<p>These initiatives are also attempting to create awareness about climate change among Nigeria’s rural youth. Already, a group of ICT savvy young people has starting building “The Hive,” a SMS app that establishes paths of communication with rural women farmers to disseminate climate information and provide data on trends and predictions.</p>
<div id="attachment_545" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-545" class="size-full wp-image-545" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png" alt="Gbagyi women tending to the fields (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-545" class="wp-caption-text">Gbagyi women tending to the fields (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>In a 2015 address, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared that “rural women are the backbone of sustainable livelihoods and provide food security for their families and communities.” But these women often face difficulties when it comes to obtaining critical financial resources, capacity-building activities and technologies. This lack of information and access often prevents them from taking a leadership role in climate change adaptation and mitigation in their communities. Women are also often underrepresented in the decision-making process on climate change strategies at local and international levels, painfully limiting their ability to contribute, implement solutions and apply their expertise.</p>
<p>For Gbagyi women, being better informed of climactic data and the causes and effects of climate change is essential to helping them manage finite resources and adapt their livelihood strategies to a changing environment.</p>
