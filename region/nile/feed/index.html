								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abdullah Salam walks up and down his narrow plot, tossing fistfuls of wheat seeds with a light flick of his wrist as the soil squishes beneath his bare feet. “<em>Elhamdullillah,</em>” he says—praise God—a strong rain just came through and softened the ground. A month ago, this earth was as hard as asphalt.</p>
<p>These days, it feels to Salam like his soil is fighting him. It’s quick to dry out, turning hard and gray. The seeds don’t seem to like it: No matter how much money he spends on fertilizers, he’s getting slightly lower yields every harvest. And no matter how much he irrigates the land, it’s always thirsty. Always.</p>
<div id="attachment_33" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33" class="size-large wp-image-33" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="A thin white film on the sun-scorched earth in a field betrays the reason for dying crops; salt.

<p>But there’s nothing to be done about it, and there’s no one to complain to here in Kafr el-Sheikh, in the center of Egypt’s Nile Delta, so Salam carries on planting. He, his wife and his 15-year-old son, Mohammed, scatter the wheat seeds around his 2-acre field. Their neighbor then drives his tractor through it, tilling the soil and pushing the seeds deep into the ground. Once that’s done, they all have tea and wait.</p>
<p>“The harvest will be in five or six months, <em>inshallah</em> [God willing],” Salam says. “One [acre] used to yield 18 or 20 <em>ardab</em> [worth about $1000]. But now we’ll probably only get 10.” Salam will sell half of that at market for about $250, and the other half his wife will mill into flour and bake into bread. But it’s nearly impossible to make such a small amount of flour stretch until the next harvest, she says.</p>
<p>This land, where the Nile spreads out to meet the sea, once grew enough wheat to feed everyone from Cairo to Rome—the breadbasket of the world, they called it. Today, the delta barely feeds the farmers who cultivate it. Salam blames his diminishing returns on rising fertilizer prices and bad luck.</p>
<p>But it’s not bad luck—it’s the sea. It’s warming, rising and expanding onto the low-lying, delta lands and seeping into the water that feeds them. By the end of the century, <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">60 percent</a> of the delta region—including Salam’s field—will be so saturated with salt as to be barely farmable. As much as <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">20 percent</a> of this once-fertile land will be covered in water. When this happens, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/21/climate-change-nile-flooding-farming">two-thirds</a> of Egypt’s food will drown and two-thirds of the country’s <a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/10/10873/2013/hessd-10-10873-2013-print.pdf">population</a> will be left homeless and hungry.</p>
<h2><strong>The salt shakedown<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Sadek Mahmoud has been working the plot next to Salam’s for 65 years. He remembers when the Nile used to flood his irrigation canals every year with clear, nutrient-rich water. “I used to drink from the Nile right here. And I never ever got sick,” Mahmoud says.</p>
<p>For centuries, farmers relied solely on the Nile to water their cropland, digging a complex network of irrigation canals to connect the entire delta region to the river and its tributaries. But as Egypt’s population has soared, so has its water consumption; and as factories, power plants and megacities have emerged along the Nile’s banks, the clear, rich water of Mahmoud’s youth has been fouled by all manner of human, chemical and industrial waste. Nowadays, by the time the Nile reaches Salam and Mahmoud’s fields, it has been reduced to a brown, toxic trickle.</p>
<p>To compensate, the farmers in the area have dug a well. Salam and Mahmoud, along with about a dozen of their neighbors, take turns running a fuel-powered pump to flood their respective irrigation canals with water from the <a href="https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mXCqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;dq=nile+delta+aquifer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CNUqnxVmFP&amp;sig=fo96poV9yBUodDFZBBUGOBJwKC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI2uuoy6WDyQIVzLIUCh3vAQ8N#v=onepage&amp;q=nile%20delta%20aquifer&amp;f=false">Nile Delta aquifer</a>, a massive underground reservoir, spanning from Cairo to the Mediterranean Sea.  On the surface, this seems like a good solution to the delta’s water shortage problem, but this sort of pumping is accelerating the region’s demise, according to Badr Mabrouk, a hydrology professor at Zagazig University. “When you draw the water up from the deep aquifers, it creates pressure and it draws the sea in,” Mabrouk said.</p>
<p>Rising sea levels had already put the Nile Delta aquifer in peril before farmers began deep-well pumping, Mabrouk explained, but they have made it worse. The way coastal aquifers work is that they meet and hold back the sea underground at a point called the transition zone: The higher density saltwater sinks and gets pulled back toward the ocean and the freshwater remains on top. As long as sea levels—and aquifer levels—remain stable, this meeting point doesn’t move.</p>
<p>But if either the sea rises or the fresh water recedes, this point moves farther inland: The sea advances underground. In the case of the Nile Delta, both are happening and they’re happening quickly, Mabrouk said. As the ocean warms and its waters expand, sea levels in Egypt are rising, and the land is sinking at a rate of 0.1 inches per year as a result, according to the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa Program</a>. Meanwhile, excessive pumping is draining the aquifer faster than rainfall can refill it.</p>

<p>Climate scientists and geologists have been warning of the danger of saltwater intrusion in Egypt’s Delta for decades. But in a country riven with political upheaval and economic insecurity, the environment has never been the government’s priority—and still isn’t, according to Hassan Husseiny, a water management specialist for the American University in Cairo’s <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Sustainability/Rise/Pages/Home.aspx">Research Institute for Sustainable Environment</a>. “Studies say climate change could begin to have a real effect after 20 years,” Husseiny says. “The government doesn’t look that far ahead.”</p>
<p>But up in the northern Delta region, sea-level rise is no longer a matter of looking ahead: On a daily basis, the sea is pounding away at the populous cities of Alexandria, Damietta and Port Said. If the sea rises by even 20 inches (which <a href="http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise">a 2014 National Climate Assessment</a> projects will likely occur by 2100) <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">30 percent of Alexandria</a>, a city of 5 million, will be inundated.</p>
<p>In the popular coastal resort town of Baltim, about 30 miles north of Kafr el-Sheikh, mango farmer Mossad Abu Ghali has seen the sea advancing. “I remember when they had to build a new boardwalk because the old one got ruined by the sea,” Abu Ghali says. “That was a long time ago though. Inshallah, the sea is not advancing anymore.” Baltim built a seawall in 1992 out of large, concrete tetrapod blocks. This has slowed—but not stopped—the sea’s advance. This type of structure, known as a <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/statclim/whatcanbedone.html">revetment</a>, has an average life span of 30 to 50 years. Already the wall is half-buried in sand.</p>
<p>All along the coast, cities and towns like Baltim have constructed sea walls to try and hold back the water, but even with these measures in place, Husseiny predicted that no fewer than 10 million people would be displaced in the next 30 years.</p>
<h2><strong>The Delta’s eleventh hour</strong></h2>
<p>In 1972, Egypt launched the Coastal Research Institute (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Coastal-Research-Institute-Cori-436770736371496/info/?tab=overview">CORI</a>) to “monitor and protect” the Egyptian coast, but to date, its work has focused far more on monitoring than protecting. “There has yet to be any action taken in the delta that I know of,” Husseiny said. “There have been conferences and meetings and discussions but no action.”</p>
<p>The institute’s current flagship program is a joint venture started in 2009 with the United Nations Development Program and Global Environment Facility. The project is to create “<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/dam/egypt/docs/Environment%20and%20Energy/Climate%20Change%20Project%20Document.pdf">integrated coastal zone management systems</a>” on Egypt’s coasts by building sea barriers out of natural materials. Six years and <a href="http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/sccf-czm-egypt">$4 million later</a>, they have managed to “select a pilot site,” design an “adaptation technique” and solicit bids from contractors to work on a pilot site—but have <a href="http://www.eg.undp.org/content/egypt/en/home/operations/projects/environment_and_energy/project_sample.html">yet to build</a> a single sea barrier.</p>
<p>Aymen el-Gamal, CORI’s deputy director, works out of an office less than half a mile from the sea, and he doesn’t deny the sea levels are rising. But, he says, there is little use in trying to predict the rate at which it will rise—and there’s no sense in planning more  than one or two years ahead. Most existing models are just alarmist and unhelpful, el-Gamal says. He’s also unconvinced human-induced climate change is real. “The Earth is very clever. It can take in energy and emit it,” el-Gamal says. “There are those who say there is the greenhouse effect and the ozone—no, the Earth is bigger than all of this.” His smile is confident and kind. “So the climate change from my point of view is a normal phenomenon.” Which is why he sees his role as one of simply monitoring sea-level rise and adapting to the data as it comes in.</p>
<p>For farmers like Salam, Mahmoud and Abu Ghali, however, that won’t work. The hour is late for the delta. “The land is slowly, slowly running out of time,” Mabrouk said. Egypt’s primary food source is sinking into the sea while its government—and the international community—watches on.</p>

<p>Global leaders are gearing up for the landmark COP21 climate change summit in Paris, where they are hoping to reach consensus on a new set of regulations for greenhouse gas emissions to replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2020. But even the most aggressive of global reforms won’t do a thing to save Egypt’s Nile Delta. Even if global leaders succeed in their goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (an ambitious goal to begin with), the seas are expected to continue rising for decades to come, according to a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/071615-international-report-confirms-2014-was-earths-warmest-year-on-record.html">report</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.</p>
<p>Land loss and damage from climate change are on the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/session/9057.php">agenda</a> for the summit, but it’s unlikely that Egypt’s case will be discussed specifically. Ultimately, the United Nations Framework for Climate Change has left it to individual countries to develop their own <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/workstreams/national_adaptation_plans/items/6057.php">National Adaptation Plans</a>. Egypt’s prime minister formed a <a href="http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/07/17/egypt-to-form-national-climate-change-council/">National Committee on Climate Change</a> in July to draft an up-to-date national strategy for combatting the problem, but a copy of this strategy has not been made public (if indeed it has been fully drafted).</p>
<p>In the meantime, there has been little if any international pressure on Egypt to update its national strategy expediently. All international critiques of Egypt tend to focus on the country’s national security problems, human rights abuses and poor democratic governance. As long as climate change remains a second-tier issue for the international community, the Egyptian state—and its people—will also regard it as one.</p>
<p>Even Abu Ghali, whose mango trees could be floating in saltwater within his lifetime, believes tackling climate change should come second to tightening security and restoring the economy. He has full confidence his president will help him in due time. “The government is under a lot of pressure,” Abu Ghali says. “We can’t expect everything to come all at once. [President Abdel-Fattah ] el-Sissi needs to first give jobs to people who need them. Later, he will help us.” Inshallah.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahmed Rizq watched the mercury on his thermometer rise: 48, 53…55 degrees Celsius. It rose higher than he had ever seen it rise before. And then it stayed there—for over three weeks. Rizq had lived in Aswan in the very south of Egypt his whole life; he could take a little heat. But August 2015 was a new kind of hot. It was the sort of hot that could kill you.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health began distributing flyers to hospitals all around the country, encouraging citizens to stay at home if possible and avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. But those flyers never reached the desert village of Ladid, and even if they had, they wouldn’t have made a difference, said Rizq, who researches public health access for the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights. “The village is close to a mountain in the desert,” Rizq described. “There isn’t a water source inside, you’re outside the agricultural area by some kilometers.”</p>
<div id="attachment_16" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16" class="size-large wp-image-16" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Near the Sudan border, Aswan endures some of the highest temperatures in Egypt.

Despite the cool Nile winding alongside the city, many residents suffer from heatstroke and even death in the summer months. (Credit: Nicholas Linn)</p></div>
<p>Ladid, like most small Egyptian villages, is served by a modest medical center. In general, these centers are well equipped but lack the staff to run them, Rizq said, because anyone who can get enough medical experience to get out of his village usually does. The closest hospital is in Edfu, about an hour and a half away by public transport. By mid-August, Ladid residents were shuttling their sick and dying to and from Edfu, Luxor and Aswan general hospitals. “They were taking people one after the other to the hospital,” Rizq said. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.”</p>
<p>Ladid was hardly the only village to be overwhelmed by the crushing heat. As August crept along and the heatwave persisted, the city hospitals became overrun as patients poured in from surrounding rural villages. Heat stroke, dehydration, high blood pressure, heart attacks: the cases kept on coming and the hospitals soon ran out of beds. The <a href="https://www.google.com.eg/maps/place/Luxor+International+Hospital/@25.6872365,32.6401085,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x582cf806bf20672?sa=X&amp;ved=0CHIQ_BIwDWoVChMI9Kf4kP7byAIVSg8aCh3uLgNH">Luxor International Hospital,</a> widely considered to be the best hospital south of Assiut, was overflowing.</p>
<p>“The emergency wing can treat up to 300 patients at a time, 50 at a time in the ICU,” said an emergency room doctor who asked not to be named, as he had been instructed not to speak to the press about the heatwave. “We were always full. People had to wait.”</p>
<p>The death toll began to rise. By the second week of August, <a href="http://www.vetogate.com/1768105">13 Ladid residents had died</a>, according to local journalist Doaa Ibrahim. “They would take them to the local medical center and then to the hospital in Edfu and they would die there or on the way,” Ibrahim said. “But the government didn’t count these as heat-related deaths. They said they died of high blood pressure or liver problems or heart problems.”</p>
<p>And so when the Ministry of Health announced the official tally of heatwave casualties later that week, Ladid’s dead were not counted among them. As it stands, the official death toll for entire country stopped at <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/08/22/ministry-of-health-denies-meningitis-outbreak-in-luxor-following-deaths/">110 this summer</a>, with a mere <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/138650/Egypt/Politics-/Four-die-in-Egypts-Aswan-due-to-continued-heatwave.aspx">11 casualties</a> from Aswan, but dozens, if not hundreds more have gone unaccounted for, Rizq said. “They say [the Ladid villagers] died of natural causes, but how can you tell me 13 people from the same place died in one week from natural causes?” Rizq said.</p>
<div id="attachment_27" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27" class="size-large wp-image-27" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ahmed Rizq, an Egyptian public health researcher and lawyer, told Al Monitor that there were at least 50 heat-related deaths in the Aswan governorate alone this past summer. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.” (Credit: Nicholas Linn)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-27" class="wp-caption-text">Ahmed Rizq, an Egyptian public health researcher and lawyer, told Al Monitor that there were at least 50 heat-related deaths in the Aswan governorate alone this past summer. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.” (Credit: Nicholas Linn)</p></div>
<p>The emergency room doctor at the Luxor International Hospital confirmed that plenty of heatstroke cases went undocumented. “Officially, we maybe had 5 diagnosed cases a day of heatstroke, but we certainly saw a noticeable rise in heat deaths this summer, even if not all were documented,” he said. “Each doctor has to make his own diagnosis. One could write ‘heat stroke’ and the other could write ‘acute renal failure’ and he wouldn’t necessarily be wrong.”</p>
<p>When Al Monitor asked the hospital deputy director Nahed Ahmed Mohammed for the official number of heatstroke patients and casualties from this summer, he declined to comment.</p>
<p>“All I know is what we observe, and that’s that when the temperature goes up, the number of deaths goes up,” said Aswan resident Khaled Sadek, “We don’t have conclusive proof that the heat was what caused the death. And so that’s what you see in the government studies. Hospitals, when they get cases like these, have a lot of causes they can pick from. But that’s not actually helpful for researching the problem and understanding what’s going on here.”</p>
<p>What’s going on here, in a nutshell, is that Aswan, along with the rest of Egypt is getting hotter with every passing year. As of 2010, <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/ccl16/teco/documents/ppt/TECO-Presentations-PDF/01-7-2014/Session6/1500-1520/4-Presentation1for_conf_1jul.pdf">data from the Egyptian Meteorological Authority</a> showed that Egypt’s five hottest years in recorded history have occurred from the year 2002 onward. The data also showed that heatwaves are becoming more common and prolonged. From 2001 to 2010, Aswan recorded over 100 days with temperatures in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher—whereas in the 70s, that number was closer to 40, the study showed.</p>
<p>And as this past summer revealed, the heat is starting to take its toll. Rizq estimated that there were no fewer than 50 deaths in the Aswan governorate alone—but these casualties are just the tip of the iceberg. Bahaa George, an obstetrician at the more modest Luxor General Hospital, said the heat is proving damaging to unborn children and their mothers.</p>
<p>“When you are pregnant, you are particularly at risk of dehydration,” George said. “It can severely affect the amniotic fluid. If the mother is dehydrated, she will draw her amniotic fluid from her urine. There will also be comparatively less blood flow to the fetus and the baby’s immunity will be lower.”</p>
<p>While George said it was too soon for him to have noticed any trends in maternal or infant mortality as a result, he did say the heat was negatively affecting his patients and could cause further problems down the road.</p>
<p>For several years after they’re born, children remain particularly at risk of heat stroke and dehydration and parents are encouraged to keep them at home if temperatures climb to over 40 degrees. This will have a profound effect on elementary education rates, Sadek said. “A child can’t go out and play in the streets, he can’t go to school. And when he does go to school, he doesn’t learn anything. Most schools here don’t even have a fan,” Sadek said.</p>

<p>Additionally, rising temperatures risk leading to an increase in parasitical diseases, according to Wael Lotfy, a professor of parasitology at the faculty of Medical Research in Alexandria University. What worries him most is the possibility that in the next three or four decades, malaria could be reintroduced to Egypt if malaria-carrying mosquitoes begin to migrate north from Sudan.</p>
<p>“With global warming it is possible that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/"><em>Anapholese gambiae</em></a> [a malaria carrying mosquito] expands its range of distribution to Egypt, and hence introduces the parasite to the country,” Lotfy said. The mosquito has already been reported in Aswan and Toshka, though it was not carrying malaria.</p>
<p>In addition to malaria, Egypt could see a resurgence of <a href="http://www.who.int/schistosomiasis/en/"><em>schistosomiasis</em></a>, a disease caused by tiny worms burrowing their way through the human vascular system, harming the liver, bladder and blood vessels. The worms are carried by a particular variety of snail that thrives in warm, stagnant water. As the flow of water through the Nile and its canals lessens, Lotfy expects to see an increase in these snails, accompanied by an increase in <em>schistosomiasis</em> cases. Now more than ever, the Ministry of Health needs to ensure the accurate reporting of parasitical diseases and monitor their spread, Lotfy said. Other than that though, there isn’t much anyone can do but wait and see.</p>
<p>That’s what’s hardest for Sedky: to know the future of his homeland is out of his hands.</p>
<p>“Most of these poor people aren’t part of the problem: they use simple tools that don’t hurt the environment. But then the end result is a lot of problems that fall on them,” Sedky said. “I don’t want to live in a skyscraper. I just want to live on an island with water around me and clean environment beneath me. You can live in a skyscraper if you want but don’t you choose something that’s going to hurt me in the end. Live the way you want to live but don’t live in such a way that will hurt me here.”</p>
