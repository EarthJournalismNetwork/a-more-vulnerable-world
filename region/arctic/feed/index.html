								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is early Thursday evening in mid-September; the sun is setting into a veil of smog from the power plants and people are coming back from work. This could be any small industrial town in Russia, but it is Norilsk — a northern city of 180 thousand people with an average annual temperature of minus 9.8 degrees Celsius. There is a one in three chance the palladium in your mobile phone was mined here. Norilsk is also officially the most polluted city in Russia and one of the most polluted in the world.</p>
<p>I was born in the capital of the Krasnoyarsk region, of which Norilsk is the second largest city. This is my first time so far north, some 1,500 kilometers away from where my family still lives. During a walk around town, I found myself standing in front of an apartment building whose aboveground foundations are big enough to walk into. It may sound strange to most, but this style of building has been adapted for the presence of permafrost.</p>
<p>In Norilsk and other northern cities, buildings are “lifted” above ground to ensure an air gap limits the amount of thermal impact on the frozen ground. Otherwise warm water and heat from the building can melt the permafrost cover, decreasing its bearing capacity or how much weight the foundation can hold. Often permafrost melts unevenly, which leads to cracks in larger, more complex structures and even partial collapses.</p>
<div id="attachment_84" style="width: 439px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-image-84" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min-683x1024.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost" width="429" height="643" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-8-min-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-84" class="wp-caption-text">Peering into the lifted foundation of a building in Norilsk (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see what the foundation looks like — through the gaping hole in the side of the housing structure. While this hole is there to prevent the melting permafrost, it may be adding to it. Some thermal impact is unavoidable, but it’s clear that these permafrost-reinforced buildings are not getting the maintenance they need. And yet, no one returning home from a long day of work appears to be worried that this hole is there.</p>
<h2>Uncommon ground</h2>
<p>Explorers of the Russian East during the 17<sup>th</sup> century had a difficult time convincing the capital that they really had found soil that stayed frozen year round, even in the summer when only a thin top layer would melt. We now know that permafrost actually covers two-thirds of Russia’s territory —more than the total area of Canada.</p>
<p>This frozen land is home to more than a third of the country’s proved reserves of oil and gas and over 90% of estimated reserves, some of the largest gold, tin, nickel, copper and coal deposits, as well as freshwater and forest resources. Large-scale industrial exploration of the region, which started in the 20th century, required building power plants, factories and housing that could withstand the frozen ground and extreme conditions of the North. A growing need to better understand the science behind permafrost sparked robust research efforts in the Soviet Union during this time.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, the country had а specialized permafrost research institution, with a vast network of monitoring stations in western and eastern Siberia. Experimental sites were also set up to study permafrost under various stresses and conditions. The USSR held the world’s second international conference on the subject in July 1973, in the East Siberian city of Yakutsk, where attendees could see &#8220;six-story apartment buildings being constructed” as well as the 117 meter “well”, or Shergin shaft, used for the first scientific study of permafrost a century earlier.</p>

<p>A history museum in the central Siberian town of Igarka tells the story of early settlers who started building a lumber mill in the summer of 1929. The town later rose to prominence as a regional hub for the international lumber trade, but the early houses and structures they constructed barely survived the winter as people were not prepared to deal with complications stemming from building on the frozen surface. Igarka’s permafrost research station was founded later that year.</p>
<h2>New times</h2>
<p>Today, the people and industry that drove migration to the inhospitable region are still there. The Russian Arctic is home to some 2 million people who produce around 4% of the country’s GDP and 20% of its exports. Another 5 million live in the so-called sub-Arctic regions. Most of these estimates can vary quite significantly across sources, in part because legal boundaries of what is now officially called the Russian Arctic zone were not defined until the spring of 2014.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the global Arctic, Russia’s Far North is already a highly urbanized region with over 80% of the population living in settlements of 5,000 people or greater. Approximately 40 towns in the area have populations of over 10,000 people; at least five – Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Noyabrsk, Novy Urengoy and Norilsk – have more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>But most of these settlements are getting smaller, mainly due to economic migration. Murmansk, the world’s largest city north of the Arctic Circle, and Norilsk have lost about a third of their populations since 1990. For smaller settlements such as Igarka or Tiksi on the Arctic coast of Yakutia, the figure is closer to 60 or 70%. Overall, the region is estimated to have lost a quarter to a third of its population in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>Shrinking populations and general socioeconomic stagnation in towns that are no longer connected to oil and gas, or mining industries are partly to blame for the neglect visible in older buildings, not unlike the one I walked into in Norilsk. Local municipalities responsible for this upkeep receive little to no support from the higher levels of government and often have no means of adequately funding the continuous maintenance required for Soviet-era infrastructure.</p>
<div id="attachment_83" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83" class="wp-image-83 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min-1024x685.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost" width="760" height="508" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-7-min-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-83" class="wp-caption-text">Poor housing maintenance is no laughing matter (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>Over the last few decades, interest in permafrost has also plummeted. Russian papers on the subject and a 2014 state report on climate change give an overview of the extent of damage to buildings in Igarka, Tiksi and other smaller settlements on permafrost in the Siberian North and further to the east. Numbers range from place to place, between 40 or 50 percent of all structures with deformations in some cities and even 100 percent in unnamed remote settlements in the Siberian Arctic. This review relies mainly on a non-peer-reviewed source from 2001.</p>
<p>Dr. Oleg Anisimov of the State Hydrological Institute in Saint Petersburg, who was one of the lead authors of the 2014 report, agrees the data is old but says there is simply no newer information because hardly anyone is studying this issue now. &#8220;Permafrost itself is a really simple thing, actually, all processes there are incredibly well understood. The difficulty lies in the fact that there’s very little data on its current state and trends”, he adds.</p>
<p>A lot of Russian research on permafrost conditions such as temperature or active layer thickness – how deep it melts in the short summers – ceased in the 1990s when political and economic turmoil left research stations severely underfunded and understaffed. Data from Roshydromet, the state weather and climate service, suggests that in 2014, only 36 out of 64 Russian stations involved in the global Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) project actually collected data, and most had continual measurements for no longer than 10 to 15 years. This lack of data complicates any estimate of long-term trends, says Dr. Anisimov.</p>
<p>“Only 12 to 15 of these stations in Russia have long time series, and they are used in the analysis. And now try and picture those 12 to 15 stations, most of which are located along the Arctic coast, against the whole area of Russian permafrost,” Anisimov, who is also involved in gathering and processing this data, notes. Overall, the CALM network has 168 stations in 15 countries; Canada, where permafrost covers about half the landmass, has some 60 stations with measurements dating back to the start of the project in 1991.</p>
<p>Symbolically, a decades-old map documenting permafrost cover adorns the wall of the director’s office in the Igarka research station. Dated 1991, it’s a comprehensive picture of permafrost conditions across Siberia and elsewhere, but it’s also a map of a different country – the Soviet Union. Dr. Nikita Tananaev, former head of the research station and a research scientist with the Melnikov Permafrost Insitute in Yakutsk, says newer maps of permafrost conditions do exist, but they cover smaller areas and much of the information gathered, for instance, by oil and gas companies is proprietary. “To make a new map at this scale — this one is quite detailed — we would have to collect lots and lots of new data. And there is no one to make everyone share the information they do have.” he says.</p>
<h2>A cold topic</h2>
<p>According to WWF Russia’s Dr. Alexey Kokorin, who works to develop climate change awareness in these regions, there is little interest in sharing this information and building a more accurate picture of the state of permafrost. Oil and gas companies who have invested in this research have already built their infrastructure to be &#8220;almost immune to changes in permafrost.” Government estimates, however, indicate that it may still cost them up to 55 billion rubles (a little over $800 million) a year in maintenance. And since a decrease in population is naturally followed by a decrease in demand for housing, the plight of the people remaining in these crumbling Arctic settlements “is not really sounding the alarms”, says Kokorin.</p>
<p>There’s also a surprising complacency from those left to deal with “building deformities&#8221; on a daily basis. A section of apartments in a residential building in Igarka had to be abandoned after damage to the foundation had rendered them unsafe — but residents still live in other parts of that complex. Two houses down that street, an entire half of another building had to be demolished. It seems like much of this acceptance of present conditions stems from a peculiar fatalism common to all Russians but particularly striking in the North. When I asked a woman who had lived in that apartment building for 10 years if she was scared to stay there, she expressed a sentiment I would continue to hear throughout my trip: of course I am, but what is there to do?</p>
<div id="attachment_63" style="width: 265px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/pic-06-223x337.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" class="wp-image-63 " src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/pic-06-223x337.jpg" alt="Dobrovidova - Permafrost 3" width="255" height="385" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-06-223x337.jpg 223w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-06-223x337-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-63" class="wp-caption-text">Building degrading from permafrost (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>During my travels, I passed a shiny new youth activity center in Dudinka, a major river port town the Siberian Arctic. The building had a memorable poem written on its side: “If we have to, then we have to, then our gardens here will bloom.” It’s a quote from a Soviet song called “70th Parallel Kids.” Sitting at the 69<sup>th</sup> parallel, Dudinka is close, but it’s so cold you can barely grow onions here.</p>
<p>Residents of the North are quite aware of the changing climate realities they face, but the issue of thawing permafrost has taken a backseat to other concerns. In casual conversations about the weather, people often lament that traditional predictions of weather patterns based on years of observation no longer hold. The Yenisey, Lena and other Siberian rivers are also experiencing marked shifts in their fall freeze and spring melt times. In the Taymyr peninsula, the northernmost part of central Siberia, both indigenous communities and scientists have confirmed that deer have already started wintering in places they used to leave because of the extreme cold. While locals are worried about the future impacts of climate change on infrastructure, these problems are nothing new. Many residents have lived in these crumbling buildings for decades.</p>
<p>Despite a lack of perceived urgency, the threat posed by thawing permafrost to these settlements is real. The IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report states that, with a high level of confidence, &#8220;rising temperatures, leading to the further thawing of permafrost, and changing precipitation patterns have the potential to affect infrastructure and related services in the Arctic,” with particular concerns for damage to residential buildings and storage facilities for hazardous materials.</p>
<p>Russia’s own second assessment report on climate change and its consequences paints a more detailed picture. It asserts that climate change has already led to &#8220;a decrease in the permafrost bearing capacity by 17% on average and by up to 45% in some regions relative to the 1970s.” This means that in some parts of western Siberia, permafrost degradation is already approaching the limits of operational safety. According to the same research, degradation is less severe in the central Asian part of the Arctic, northern Yakutia and the Krasnoyarsk territory.</p>
<div id="attachment_82" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-82" class="wp-image-82 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min-1024x542.jpg" alt="A Soviet-era sign urging people to keep their houses safe and avoid permafrost degradation by keeping water and trash out of the basement (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)" width="760" height="402" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min-1024x542.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-6-min-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-82" class="wp-caption-text">A Soviet-era sign urging people to keep their houses safe and avoid permafrost degradation by keeping water and trash out of the basement (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>While Dr. Anisimov agrees that climate change is contributing to the thawing permafrost, he says there are more urgent problems to address. &#8220;A building itself really does not care why a decrease in the permafrost bearing capacity happened — it just happened. Right now the dominant factor for us is bad maintenance, and attributing this to climate [change] would be silly. It does not diminish the issue, though, it just means one problem is compounded by the other”, says Anisimov. “You cannot separate them: construction standards have to be reviewed and updated to reflect changing climate norms.”</p>
<h2>Limits of risk</h2>
<p>In theory, any new construction in the north should be planned with climate change in mind, but Anisimov says he has yet to come across a project whose developers are accounting for this risk. “There is this very clear idea among engineers that climate change is completely made up and a hoax. Yes, sometimes it’s warmer — but there are always fluctuations and that is why safety factors exist,” he says. “Climate science is in one corner and engineering is in another.”</p>
<p>This reluctance to bring climate change into the engineering equation may seem somewhat understandable. The second national assessment report claims that improper management and maintenance are having a far more damaging affect on infrastructure built on permafrost than climate change. In fact, one of the major changes between this report and its predecessor from 2008 is a more conservative approach to the link between climate change and infrastructure risks and a more nuanced representation of the problem.</p>
<p>Climate change may not yet trump poor maintenance, but that does not mean it can be discounted. “Since the ultimate reason behind most failures and accidents is a decrease in bearing capacity, which is projected to continue throughout this century, the current problems with infrastructure &lt;…&gt; can be viewed as a physical model of what can happen due to climate change in the absence of other impacts”, the report continues.</p>
<div id="attachment_80" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-80" class="wp-image-80 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min-1024x642.jpg" alt="Dudinka, a city of contrasts in housing maintenance (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)" width="760" height="476" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min-1024x642.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-2-min-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-80" class="wp-caption-text">Dudinka, a city of contrasts in housing maintenance (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>In other words, just as with extreme weather events, even though climate change may only be partly responsible for what we are seeing now, it is a very useful snapshot into what can happen in the future, even with proper construction and maintenance. It may well become the straw that breaks the camel’s back or, in this case, the foundation pile.</p>
<p>Anisimov also notes that the common safety factor Russians use for bearing capacity, whether or not permafrost is involved, is around 40%. This number means that a Russian foundation pile can potentially hold 40% more weight than it will actually have to once a building has been constructed — it’s a margin left for safety purposes. In other countries like the U.S. or Canada it’s closer to 90%, so “this means an eventual decline in bearing capacity due to rising temperatures in the permafrost will approach the safety limits much sooner here [in Russia] than in other places,” he says.</p>
<h2>Left out in the cold</h2>
<p>Permafrost degradation and the resulting risks to infrastructure used to fall under the responsibility of the Ministry of Regional Development. In a report submitted to the UN in 2013, Russia announced that its ministry was “leading the development of a science–based set of measures to minimize risks to buildings, transport and infrastructure from the southern permafrost border shifting to the north.”</p>
<p>According to court documents and information from the federal procurement system, the ministry did contract work on this initiative out to a Moscow construction research institute in August 2012. But then in September 2014 this ministry was dissolved, and experts say it is not immediately clear which agencies, if any, took over its climate change portfolio. A representative of the Gersevanov Research Institute of Bases and Underground Structures confirmed that it completed a $270,000 study for the government, but is still waiting to be paid. Its research has not been released to the public.</p>
<div id="attachment_81" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81" class="wp-image-81 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min-1024x663.jpg" alt="Some maintenance being done in Norilsk may be too little, too late (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)" width="760" height="492" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WE-photo-5-min-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-81" class="wp-caption-text">Some maintenance being done in Norilsk may be too little, too late (Credit: Olga Dobrovidova)</p></div>
<p>At the 2014 UN climate conference in Lima, countries from Chile to Finland met to discuss the impacts of climate change on glaciers, ice caps and the Polar Regions. Russia has the largest amount of permafrost in the world, yet its delegation was noticeably absent. That was a public outreach event with no direct impact on the negotiations but it was still striking to see the same indifference found everywhere from official strategies to city streets.</p>
<p>Climate change may continue to trail engineering issues in its impact on Arctic buildings, or it may eventually force us to reinvent construction on permafrost altogether. A new building in the early stages of construction that I found in Norilsk may one day crack due to simple neglect — or it may do so because of failure to account for climate change risks in the project. The need for accurate and relevant information on the state of permafrost in a changing climate has never been more pressing. Whether or not Russia is willing to study or discuss this problem, extensive infrastructure damage in the North as well as the worries of those who live there are unlikely to melt away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is taking a heavy economic toll on Canada&#8217;s far north, with buildings collapsing as melting permafrost destroys foundations, rivers running low and wildfires all a drain on the region&#8217;s limited finances, senior government officials said.</p>
<p>A sprawling area spanning the Arctic Circle with a population of less than 50,000, Canada&#8217;s Northwest Territories has spent more than $140 million in the last two years responding to problems linked to global warming, the territory&#8217;s finance minister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our budgets are getting squeezed dramatically from climate change,&#8221; Finance and Environment Minister J. Michael Miltenberger said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The roads are constantly moving as the permafrost is melting&#8230; massive shore erosion is putting buildings at risk. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few years and the tie to climate change is more and more evident.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this windswept territory, which already relies on central government subsidies, responding to global warming is crucial for its financial survival.</p>
<p>A major U.N. conference in Paris in December will aim to create a new global deal to curb climate change to take effect from 2020.</p>
<p>Scientists want to keep international temperature rises below 2 degrees compared with pre-industrial levels, while providing poor countries with money for adaptation.</p>
<p>But in parts of the Northwest Territories, average temperatures have already risen more than three degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels, government officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Paris, we are hoping for whatever it takes to turn this (climate change) around,&#8221; politician Bob Bromley said in the territorial capital, Yellowknife.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to require all hands on deck, and willing hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>DIESEL DEPENDENCE</p>
<p>The delicate ecosystem of the wide-skied territory, home to the indigenous Dene people, and where wolves, caribou and bison roam, has been plunged into a environmental vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Climate change has been linked to decreased water levels in the territory&#8217;s major rivers, partly due to greater evaporation, causing a sharp contraction in hydro electric power generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_45" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/FullSizeRender.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45" class="size-large wp-image-45" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/FullSizeRender-1024x768.jpg" alt="The town of Yellowknife (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FullSizeRender-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FullSizeRender-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-45" class="wp-caption-text">The town of Yellowknife (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)</p></div>
<p>As a result, the government has had to import more diesel, borrowing about $30 million this year alone to make up for the electricity shortfall, hurting its budget and increasing climate-warming emissions in a catastrophic feedback loop.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not sustainable,&#8221; said Miltenberger, the finance and environment minister.</p>
<p>He called on Canada&#8217;s national government to provide more financial help for climate change mitigation, particularly in renewable power, to reduce the costs of importing diesel.</p>
<p>With a small population, and high operating costs due to its size and climate, the territory&#8217;s main employers are diamond mining and the public sector. The region&#8217;s indigenous people rely on the hunting of caribou as a key food source, but herds are declining, with climate change likely a significant driver.</p>
<p>Northwest Territories <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/fedprov/mtp-eng.asp"><strong>receives</strong></a> financial transfer payments of about $1.3 billion, or about $29,000 per resident, from Canada&#8217;s national government to run public services.</p>
<p>Craig Scott, executive director of Ecology North, a Yellowknife-based environmental group, believes the government should have invested earlier in renewable energy.</p>
<p>Fuel trucks hauling diesel along gravel roads to small rural communities are a common site across the territory.</p>
<p>Generators have been working around the clock following the decline in hydro power, Scott said, and new holding tanks had to be imported to store the diesel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Renewable energies (including) micro hydro, solar and biomass have high capital costs in the short-term,&#8221; Scott said. &#8220;But they are sustainable versus the long-term pain of diesel.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When tracking climate change in the Arctic, scientists rely not just on satellites and software but tap the knowledge of indigenous hunters who have lived in the frozen north for generations.</p>
<p>To help them understand shifts underway in parts of the far north, including the increasing frequency of disasters, NASA Emeritus Scientist Nancy Maynard and her team are working with reindeer herders in Scandinavia to track changing temperature and precipitation patterns.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are out on the tundra year round, so they are able to give us information on the state of the snow that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to get otherwise,&#8221; Maynard said.</p>
<p>Such on-the-ground data allows scientists such as Maynard to calibrate satellite censors used to track weather patterns.</p>
<p>Indigenous people are often particularly hit by disasters and climate change, and their knowledge is becoming increasingly important in mitigating the problems, scientists and activists said.</p>
<div id="attachment_56" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/IMG_6519.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56" class="size-large wp-image-56" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/IMG_6519-1024x683.jpg" alt="Members from the Dene Nation in northern Canada are heavily impacted by climate change (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_6519-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_6519-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-56" class="wp-caption-text">Members from the Dene Nation in northern Canada are heavily impacted by climate change (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)</p></div>
<p>The United Nations has designated October 13 as the <a href="http://www.unisdr.org/2015/iddr/"><strong>International Day of Disaster Reduction</strong></a>, with a focus on how indigenous knowledge can complement science to boost resilience as the costs of disasters rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a two-way street,&#8221; when it comes to data sharing in the face of climate change, Maynard said.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed that view.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Arctic region, we depend greatly on the local knowledge of indigenous peoples to understand the impacts of climate change,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were three times as many natural disasters from 2000 to 2009 as there were from 1980 to 1989, with much of the increase coming from &#8220;climate-related events&#8221;, according to a 2013 study from the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen the destruction of communities because of the loss of sea ice, melting permafrost (and) wildfires,&#8221; said Patricia Cochran,  executive director of the Alaska Native Science Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the native villages in Alaska are being literally washed into the sea,&#8221; Cochran said, citing rising water levels and the melting of Arctic ice floes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best information and solutions come from the sharing of information from people closest to the land,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>More than 30 communities in Alaska alone need to be moved as a result of rising sea levels, melting ice and other factors, Maynard noted.</p>
<p>Various levels of government are struggling with how to finance the moves, along with other practical considerations such as who should be moved first, she said.</p>
<p>Providing resources for communities to adapt to these sorts of changes should be a focus for national governments and the United Nations, Maynard said.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Sami reindeer herders are facing an external threat to keeping their centuries-old tradition alive – climate change. According to scientists, the Arctic region, home to the Sami people, is warming at a rate 2.5 times faster than the global average.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[vimeo 147480382 w=500 h=281]</p>
<p>On a dark, chilly November evening on the frozen Raisjavri Lake in northern Norway, Jonna Andreas Utsi and his colleagues dragged out one reindeer after another from their trailers. With a firm yet gentle grip, Utsi lay the reindeer down on the icy lake top and began untying the ropes around their feet. He occasionally made herding sounds to calm the reindeer, who stared back with their large, dark, fearful eyes.</p>
<p>Utsi and his family are Sami reindeer herders in Norway’s northern Finnmark region close to the Barents Sea. The Sami are an <a href="http://www.unric.org/en/indigenous-people/27307-the-sami-of-northern-europe--one-people-four-countries">indigenous group in Europe</a> that live in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia – a region known as Sápmi. Historical records show that Sami people have been herding reindeer <a href="http://reindeerherding.org/herders/sami-norway/">since 800 AD</a> while sustaining a nomadic way of life, moving annually between their summer and winter pastures. Only about 10 percent of the estimated 70,000 Sami people still follow the tradition of reindeer herding.</p>
<div id="attachment_283" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-10.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-283" class="wp-image-283 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-10-1024x684.jpg" alt="Jonna herds reindeer with the help of his dog and his all terrain vehicle. “Things are much easier because of that, but on the other hand, it’s also not so nice to be so mobile all the time.

(Credit: Felix Gaedtke)</p></div>
<p>Earlier that evening Utsi and his fellow herders had fetched about 20 reindeer that had wandered away from their herd of about 2,500 and joined another one. “That happens quite often. It is a big loss if we lose our reindeer to someone else,” Utsi said. He pointed towards a reindeer’s earmark, a few cuts on each ear marked while they are still calves, “This mark is mine. That means the reindeer belongs to me. My cousin has his own ear mark and my friend has his own. That helps us differentiate our reindeer from the others.”</p>
<p>Utsi began herding in his late teens after his father, also a reindeer herder, passed away. “It was a bit hard, losing my dad at a young age. It wasn’t easy to find advice or someone who could tell me how to do things. But I was connected to the reindeer, they taught me herding. I also had grandparents and relatives who helped me to learn more,” he said. Today Utsi works alongside members of his extended family – a common practice among Sami herders.</p>
<p>“Being Sami and being indigenous is our identity. Reindeer herding has been in the Sami community for hundreds of years. Sami people and reindeer are like one, we are connected together,” Utsi said proudly, “Even the months of the year in Sami calendar are named according to reindeer herding cycles.”</p>
<h2><strong>A new threat</strong></h2>
<p>However in recent years, Utsi and other Sami reindeer herders are facing an external threat to keeping their centuries-old tradition alive – climate change. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter15.pdf">According to scientists</a>, the Arctic region, home to the Sami people, is warming at a rate 2.5 times faster than the global average.</p>
<div id="attachment_276" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-276" class="size-large wp-image-276" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-3-1024x684.jpg" alt="According to climate scientists, the temperature in the Arctic is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest of the world.

(Credit: Felix Gaedtke)</p></div>
<p>The effects of increased temperatures are already visible on the frozen landscape. As Utsi rode his all-terrain vehicle (ATV) across the frozen Raisjavri Lake the following morning, he stopped over a partly frozen spot. “This is climate change. We see it every day in our work and life,” he said. “Normally during this time of the year the temperature is between -20ºC and -30ºC. But it’s really warm this year, it’s -4ºC. We have had warm autumns previously but never earlier were they so long.”</p>
<p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/05/arctic-ice-retreat-scientists-climate-change">less ice in the Arctic this winter</a> than any previous year since the beginning of satellite monitoring. Utsi got off his ATV, walked a bit further and knelt down. “Look, here,” he said, clearing the snow on the ground, “There’s snow on the surface and then ice at the bottom, above the ground. The reindeer can get through the snow, but not through the ice. They can’t get to the food.”</p>
<p>Lack of forage is one of the biggest impacts of climate change on reindeer herding. Increased precipitation due to warmer temperatures is leading to harder ice on the surface close to the ground, locking away the lichen and other plants that reindeer feed on. In the past, this has led to the herd’s starvation and even death.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if your refrigerator is full of food, but you can’t open the door,” said Anders Oskal, executive director at the <a href="http://reindeerherding.org/about-us/">International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR)</a> in Kautokeino, a town in northern Norway. Oskal went on to outline another indicator of climate change. “We have seen shrubs entering the tundra in ways it hasn’t done before,” he said, referring to a type of vegetation that the reindeer don’t eat. “There are a lot of traditional migration routes that families here have used for centuries. We can’t use these migration routes any more &#8212; the reindeer refuse to go there because there are too many shrubs. This tells us that something beyond the ordinary is happening.”</p>

(Credit: Felix Gaedtke)</p></div>
<p>The ICR offers capacity building workshops to reindeer herders across the world. One of their areas of focus is promoting traditional indigenous knowledge that helps mitigate effects of climate change. “None of the 24 indigenous groups around the world herding reindeer has the term ‘sustainable development’ in our languages. Where did that term originate? To us it’s a given. We would like to see our children and their children to continue the life that we are living,” Oskal said.</p>
<p>He pulled out a poster that explained how traditional Sami knowledge and practices can help to mitigate the effects of climate change. “You can design your reindeer herd. Male castrates are the biggest and strongest animals in the herd. It calms the herd down and more importantly, they are stronger and able to dig through hard snow and face difficult conditions in winter time. This is important because the climate is not just being warmed but also more variable,” he said. Herders across Sápmi have chosen to have more and more inactive male reindeer as a result.</p>
<p>But it’s not just warmer temperatures that are posing a risk to reindeer herding. “A warmer Arctic is also a more accessible Arctic, explained Oskal. “Loss of pastures due to encroachment and fragmentation of pasture land for reindeer herders is one of the most serious challenges that we are facing today. Studies suggest that in the last 50 years, reindeer husbandry has lost 25 percent of land in the Barents region to encroachment,” Oskal explained. Over the past 30 years, reindeer herders have lost pastures to military fields, windmills, power lines and road construction.</p>
<h2><strong>An uphill climb </strong></h2>
<p>With many of these industries sprouting up in and around Sápmi, the younger generation is shifting away from traditional practices. Thirty four-year-old Johan Ailo Hætta, who comes from a reindeer herding family, runs a car rental company Ailo Matki &amp; Tourist in Kautokeino. “I feel sad about not continuing the tradition, but on the other hand I have the option of going out in nature and spending time there as long as I want and returning when I feel like,” he said.</p>
<p>“My business is really successful, a lot of Kroner,” Hætta joked standing outside his garage on a snowy morning. “There isn’t any other car rental company around here, so my cars are always rented out. Moreover, I employ a few young guys, so I am generating employment here,” Hætta said.</p>
<p>While decades ago, Sami reindeer herders lived nomadically in tents called <em>lavvus</em>, today they most often have permanent residences. In the 1970s, Sápmi experienced something called a “<u><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/255578485_Logical_Adaptation_to_Modern_Technology_-_Snowmobile_Revolution_in_Spmi">snowmobile revolution</a></u>,” which allowed herders more mobility and easier herding. “My grandfather would be skiing to herd and they used reindeer for transportation to get food to the tents. They also faced hard conditions in the winter. They just had one little bag of food, the dog, a gun to get reindeer, coffee and bread – hard, old bread,” Jonna Utsi recalled.</p>

<p>Utsi’s permanent home is located on the outskirts of Kautokeino town. A huge, red wooden building with rows of reindeer skin hanging outside. Utsi now divides his time between the herd and his family. On a Wednesday afternoon, while Utsi was home, he prepared a lunch of fried redfish and salad with his fiancé Briita-Marja Nutti. Their two-year-old son Jonna-Isaak played with a board game on the floor.</p>
<p>“A lot of knowledge is gone because we aren’t living with the herd and following it always,” said Nutti, a 29-year-old massage therapist. “Already when I was growing up, this changed. My father was always with the herd and coming to visit us – I don’t know how often he was away,” she said.</p>
<p>Utsi brought out a reindeer game for his son. Together they starting building the toy fence and arranging the miniature reindeer inside it. The boy took out his toy knife and marked a calf. “I hope my son will be a herder too. I hope the climate gets better,” Utsi said, “but the change is happening very fast.”</p>
<p>Changes that he never expected to see in his lifetime, he said, have taken place in only the last ten years. “That is pretty frightening,” Utsi acknowledged. “If there’s going to be so many changes, maybe we have to give up herding. That is going to be a punishment for our culture and language and everything.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous hunter Jim Antoine has watched the decline of caribou herds with alarm, convinced that global warming is at least partially responsible for the crisis in Canada&#8217;s far north.</p>
<p>An important food source for the Dene people, an indigenous group living in the northern boreal and Arctic regions of Canada, as well as for other northern communities, the caribou population has crashed in recent years. Scientists, hunters and government officials say there are several possible causes for the fall in numbers of the woodland caribou that prefer cooler conditions, but climate change is likely a significant driver.</p>
<p>In parts of the Northwest Territories, average annual temperatures have already risen more than three degrees over the past two decades, a local politician said, impacting everything from housing and transportation to the local caribou population. This comes amid rising fears that the world is not on track to limit greenhouse gas emissions to keep temperatures within a U.N. goal of two degrees Celsius (3.6 F) above pre-industrial times, which will be debated at a global conference in December.</p>

<p>&#8220;We live with (climate change) every day,&#8221; Antoine said at his home in Fort Simpson, a mostly Dene community of about 1,200 residents just over 500 kilometers south of the Arctic Circle. Piles of moose meat from a recent hunt sit on a table in his garage. A large man with thinning silver hair and wry smile, Antoine led the Northwest Territories as Premier in the late 1990s, giving him a front row seat on the changes taking place in the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the old days, it stayed cold for a longer time and there was more water on the land &#8230; all of that will impact the animals,&#8221; Antoine said between bites of moose meat and sips of tea during a late night interview in his comfortable, suburban-style home.</p>
<p>The caribou crisis is one manifestation of climate change facing residents in a region considered the &#8220;canary in the coal mine&#8221; by environmentalists, as global warming is felt here first and often with more intensity than other areas. The Arctic ecosystems, Greenland ice sheet, and tropical coral reefs are systems earmarked as particularly vulnerable to increased temperatures.</p>
<p>Scientists fear the vast, frigid Arctic region is warming at twice the rate of other parts of the globe, which threatens traditional communities even as it opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.</p>
<p>Wildlife are particularly affected by the changes. The number of breeding females in one major caribou herd, a key population indicator, dropped by half between 2015 and 2012, the territorial government said in late September.</p>
<p>In 1986, the herd was approximately 470,000 strong. Now it&#8217;s down to about 16,000.</p>
<p>As warming continues across the once frozen north, residents worry the situation will get worse. With hunted meat drying above the stove, a roaring wood fire keeping the place warm, and massive hunting dogs roaming around, Joseph Antoine, a relative of Jim&#8217;s with decades of experience on the land, worries about the future. &#8220;This decline of the caribou is not going to stop,&#8221; Joseph said. &#8220;Certain areas had a huge amount of caribou at one time.&#8221;</p>

<p>While indigenous hunters are feeling the effects of climate change first, the problems they have faced over the past two decades with increasing ferocity will invariably impact larger populations further south, scientists said.</p>
<h2>Permafrost melt</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are causing the Arctic to warm twice as fast as the global average, according to a Cambridge University study released in September. As permafrost melts due to rising temperatures, long buried carbon dioxide and methane seep from the ground, creating a potentially catastrophic feedback loop. The expected cost of melting permafrost, according to the Cambridge study, could soar to $43 trillion in economic damage by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Earlier melts and later freezing of winter ice could be part of the reason for reduced caribou populations, scientists said, as normal migration routes to breeding grounds or winter food sources are disrupted.</p>
<p>The crash in the caribou population is not unique to Canada with similar declines happening across the north, said Nancy Maynard, an Emeritus Scientist with NASA. The numbers of reindeer &#8211; a cousin of the caribou &#8211; in Norway and Russia&#8217;s eastern regions are also declining rapidly, she said, citing ice melts, increased forest fires linked to warming, and industrial development as possible causes.</p>
<p>During the winter months, caribou survive by using their hooves to dig through deep piles of snow to reach lichen and other plants buried underneath. But warmer temperatures have led to winter snow melts or rain on the snow, which later freezes, forming layers of ice interspersed with deep snow.</p>
<p>This means the caribou can&#8217;t break through the ice to forage for food and can sometimes starve due to &#8220;pasture lockout&#8221;, Maynard said. &#8220;The changes are happening so fast and it&#8217;s dramatic how people are forced to cope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rate of change has accelerated and it has been surprising scientists,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Particularly over the last few years, extreme and unpredictable weather has become really noticeable and measurable.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Healthy eating imperiled</h2>
<p>In northern villages like Fort Simpson, caribou hunting isn&#8217;t just a cultural practice honed over generations, or a marker of indigenous identity, but essential to the local diet. The meat represents a key food source in a region where groceries normally cost more than double southern prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are nutritionally affected by the caribou (decline),&#8221; Bob Bromley, a politician said during an interview at the legislature in the territorial capital Yellowknife. &#8220;They have been raised on caribou and their bodies are adjusted to deal with that kind of food. Store bought food is not as healthy and usually has higher fat and sugar content than they are used to.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_51" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/IMG_1387.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51" class="size-large wp-image-51" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/IMG_1387-1024x768.jpg" alt="Moose meat hanging in the kitchen (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1387-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1387-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51" class="wp-caption-text">Moose meat hanging in the kitchen (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)</p></div>
<p>With the decline in animal populations, and a reliance on expensive store-bought food, much of the north fares poorly for health indicators. Obesity is rising, physical activity is declining and lifestyle related ailments like diabetes and cancer are increasing across the Northwest Territories, with indigenous people particularly affected, the government said in a 2014 report. It did not provide specific statistics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to draw a direct link between negative health indicators and global warming, but residents across the region said they believed there was a connection.</p>
<p>In some small communities, people depend on traditional foods for up to a third of what they eat, said Jessie Mackenzie from the Institute for Circumpolar Health Research. &#8220;(Almost) every household has someone who hunts or traps for food,&#8221; the Dene researcher said. &#8220;The warmer temperatures are causing the caribou to become more food insecure, and we, in turn, become more food insecure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across northern Canada, the number of people depending on food aid more than doubled between 2013 and 2008, according to a report from Food Banks Canada. More than 3,500 people in Canada&#8217;s three northern regions &#8211; the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories &#8211;  now depend on food assistance in a &#8220;dire public health emergency&#8221;, the report said.</p>
<p>Along with the decline in caribou, high transportation costs of trucking or flying food throughout the Northwest Territories, an area larger than Egypt with a population of less than 50,000, also stoke food insecurity. Vegetables and other fresh foods are particularly expensive, leading some residents to opt for cheaper pasta or canned goods, exacerbating health problems.</p>
<h2>SAFETY ISSUES</h2>
<p>When moose, caribou or other large animals are available for hunting, ice melts and changes in the land due to warming are making life harder, and less safe for hunters, residents and scientists said. Many residents hunt on snowmobiles and rely on traditional knowledge of ice thickness to navigate the region&#8217;s frozen lakes and rivers with four to five feet of snow on the ground in winter.</p>
<p>With global warming, the ice in some northern regions isn&#8217;t freezing as deeply and is melting earlier, said Jamal Shirley, a manager at the Nunavut Research Institute in Canada&#8217;s northernmost territory.</p>
<p>According to Shirley, a number of younger people, who often don&#8217;t have enough traditional knowledge to know when the ice is safe, have died in recent years by falling through weak ice when fishing.</p>
<p>Problems like these can&#8217;t be blamed on climate change alone, he acknowledged, citing historical trauma faced by indigenous residents due to colonization, language loss, food insecurity and other contributing factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;With all of these factors occurring at the same time as climate change, it&#8217;s hard to look at the challenges in isolation,&#8221; said Shirley. &#8220;Ultimately, nature is in control here and human beings are vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>That vulnerability is increasing in some regions, as the weather becomes more erratic due to climate change. Some residents, including Jim Antoine, believe a five degree rise in northern temperatures is likely if current trends continue based recent rises and the amount of carbon dioxide still being emitted into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Few have faith that their situation will improve following another round of United Nations climate negotiations in Paris in December where the 193 member nations are due to agree on a new global deal to slow climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The countries doing the polluting aren&#8217;t going to stop,&#8221; said Antoine. &#8220;We aren&#8217;t the ones causing climate change, but we are the ones living with it.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniel T&#8217;seleie, an indigenous activist in the far north, is campaigning to help his people wean themselves from a worrying dependence on imported fuel and food, recover old traditions and win greater autonomy from the Canadian government.</p>
<p>In a region with nearly 24 hours of daylight in the summer, one way to help meet his goals seems obvious: more solar power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now a lot of communities in the Northwest Territories are dependent on diesel-generated electricity, along with store-bought food,&#8221; said T&#8217;seleie, in an open air interview near Behchoko, a clutch of small wooden houses nestled along the shores of Great Slave Lake.</p>
<p>Standing beside spindly jack pine trees growing from thin soil on the hard granite rock that covers much of northern Canada, T&#8217;seleie sees renewable energy as the force which could respond to the region&#8217;s complex, intertwined challenges.</p>
<div id="attachment_36" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/2015-09-30-20.37.09.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36" class="size-large wp-image-36" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/2015-09-30-20.37.09-1024x768.jpg" alt="Green energy campaigner Daniel T'seleie believes the far north has the potential to become a solar powerhouse in the summer time, due to nearly 24 hours of daylight.

<p>Canada&#8217;s north is particularly vulnerable to global warming, which is making it harder for indigenous people to continue their traditions of hunting and trapping on the land, as ice sheets are melt and caribou herds collapse.</p>
<p>And although indigenous people want what they call a &#8220;nation to nation&#8221; relationship with the Canadian government, they largely depend on it for diesel fuel in order to keep warm.</p>
<p>By harnessing renewable energy, T&#8217;seleie believes indigenous communities could gain more freedom from the state and revive ancient cultural practices, while doing their part to combat climate change which is hitting them particularly hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any way that communities can produce energy at a local level produces independence,&#8221; said the 34-year-old, sporting a baseball cap and jeans, the informal dress common in Canada&#8217;s rugged north.</p>
<h2>Solar surge</h2>
<p>The Northwest Territories has seen a surge in the use of solar power over the last five years, after the regional government spent about $50 million to boost renewable energy production and improve efficiency, said Jim Sparling, the territory&#8217;s senior climate change manager<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;On a per capita basis, we are second only to Ontario (Canada&#8217;s most populous province) for installed solar capacity,&#8221; Sparling said in the territorial capital Yellowknife.</p>
<p>The huge and sparsely populated northern territory has fewer than 50,000 residents, about half of whom are indigenous, many from the Dene Nation, a tribal people who traditionally hunt caribou.</p>
<p>Solar power still represents a fairly small part of its energy consumption, though the level is rising, said Sparling<em>.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_44" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/FullSizeRender1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44" class="size-large wp-image-44" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/FullSizeRender1-1024x768.jpg" alt="People in Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, are paying a high cost for climate change (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FullSizeRender1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FullSizeRender1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-44" class="wp-caption-text">People in Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, are paying a high cost for climate change (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)</p></div>
<p>Private individuals and companies in the territory are also installing solar panels on their own to try and bring down their energy bills and cut dependence on imports, he said.</p>
<p>That combination of rising use of renewable and better energy efficiency has allowed the province to hold its climate-changing emissions stable at 2005 levels despite a rise in the population and a growing economy, Sparling said.</p>
<p>The territorial government plans to be part of a Canadian delegation going to Paris for a U.N. climate summit in December, aimed at reaching a new global agreement on climate change.</p>
<p>Average temperatures in parts of the northern territory have already risen more than 3 degrees from pre-industrial levels, Sparling said.</p>
<p>Scientists say average world temperatures should not rise more 2 degrees if the world is to avoid the worst disasters associated with global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to scale up the ambition,&#8221; Sparling said. &#8220;We are very vulnerable if this problem gets worse.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Switch over</h2>
<p>North of the Arctic Circle, the village of Colville Lake, with fewer than 200 residents, is in the midst of a major switch from diesel power to solar.</p>
<p>Last year, the mostly indigenous community faced weekly power outages. But after a new solar power system was set-up, the area is now nearly self-sufficient in electricity production during summer months when the sun shines almost round the clock.</p>
<p>It still needs to import fuel for the winter, but officials believe the new investments will lead to a 30 percent drop in diesel consumption, helping the environment and saving money.</p>
<p>Other small northern towns are looking to mimic the project to save cash and allow people to maintain traditional lifestyles by being less dependent on expensive imports.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last 10 to 15 years there has been a huge push from (indigenous) communities to try and support themselves,&#8221; said Ashlee Cunsolo Willox, an indigenous studies professor at Cape Breton University and a researcher on climate change impacts.</p>
<p>As global warming leads to the thinning of Arctic sea ice and changes in the habits of northern animals, the region&#8217;s indigenous inhabitants are struggling to adapt their lifestyles while holding onto old traditions, she said.</p>
<p>The caribou population has collapsed in parts of the territory in a development experts link to climate change, and melting ice makes it harder for hunters to navigate the land in search of other animals to hunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The north is the fastest changing geography in the world,&#8221; Cunsolo Willox said in a phone interview. &#8220;There is a lot of concern that traditional knowledge and skills will be lost with climate change.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Old traditions, new technologies</h2>
<p>Building greater self-sufficiency – including by adapting cleaner, cheaper energy – may be a strategy for holding onto the old ways, activists say.</p>
<p>T&#8217;seleie, a law school graduate, said he previously tried to work through Canada&#8217;s court system and treaty negotiations to win greater autonomy for his people, after what he considers years of colonial abuses.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, Canadian colonial administrators declared the government&#8217;s aim was to &#8220;get rid of the Indian problem&#8221; by ending indigenous cultural practices, corralling the population into reserves and forcing aboriginal children into grim residential schools.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s government signed treaties with many indigenous groups, often in return for political support during periods of conflict, granting them access to parts of the land they once controlled and other benefits.</p>
<p>But many legal scholars and historians say the government did not honor those agreements in good faith.</p>
<p>After becoming disillusioned with the legal process, T&#8217;seleie decided working towards greater self-sufficiency in food and energy was the best way forward for indigenous people.</p>
<div id="attachment_54" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/IMG_1411.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54" class="size-large wp-image-54" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/IMG_1411-1024x768.jpg" alt="The mostly indigenous Dene village of Behchoko, a clutch of small houses nestled along the shores of Great Slave Lake, is an hour’s drive from the Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.

(Christopher Arsenault)</p></div>
<p>T&#8217;seleie is part of the first generation of indigenous people not forced to attend residential schools usually run by religious groups in other parts of Canada which took children from their parents, and forced them to speak English rather than native languages as a means of assimilation.</p>
<p>Sexual and physical abuse were rife at the institutions, the government now admits following years of litigation.</p>
<p>Health experts and indigenous leaders believe the legacy from these schools – including that many parents never learned how to raise children, as they were taken from their own parents &#8211; partially explain high rates of substance abuse, family violence and poverty in some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Allowing people to stay on their ancestral land, continuing hunting and trapping practices, and learning stories and traditions from community elders are key to overcoming these problems, said Cunsolo Willox.</p>
<p>To support traditional practices and allow indigenous communities to live off the land as they have done for centuries, they need access to renewable energy, T&#8217;seleie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A huge aspect of our lives, culture and language is lost when we can&#8217;t be on the land,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For me, that&#8217;s one of the biggest threats of climate change.&#8221;</p>

	<h3>By Felix Gaedtke and Gayatri Parameswaran </h3>
<p>Sami reindeer herders of Scandanavia are facing an external threat to keeping their centuries-old tradition alive – climate change. According to scientists, the Arctic region, home to the Sami people, is warming at a rate 2.5 times faster than the global average and the effects of increased temperatures are already visible on the frozen landscape. Sami Jonna Andreas Utsi is quick to diagnose the impact on his herd: “there’s snow on the surface and then ice at the bottom, above the ground. The reindeer can get through the snow, but not through the ice. They can’t get to the food.”</p>

<p>Indigenous hunter Jim Antoine has watched the decline of caribou herds with alarm, convinced that global warming is at least partially responsible for the crisis in Canada's far north. An important food source for the Dene people, an indigenous group living in the northern boreal and Arctic regions of Canada, as well as for other northern communities, the caribou population has crashed in recent years.</p>

<p>The vast industrial Russian Arctic is home to some 2 million people who produce around 4% of the country’s GDP and 20% of its exports. There is a one in three chance the palladium in your mobile phone was mined here. But as the permafrost, the foundations of human habitation are literally crumbling under the weight of climate impact and a legacy of neglect.   </p>
