								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking wells in the villages of southwest Bangladesh have been contaminated with salty ocean water for so long, people have gotten used to the taste. Now, scientists think that worsening salinity could be having dire, long-lasting health effects on the people living in the region — and climate change is likely to blame.</p>
<p>The world’s nations are meeting in Paris to address climate change and work towards an agreement that would limit global warming to two degrees celsius. But even if an ambitious, legally binding agreement is made, many coastal communities worldwide, including those in India and in American states like Florida, will face freshwater shortages in the coming decades as oceans continue to rise and further contaminate drinking water.</p>

<p>As a low-lying country in which nearly a third of the population lives below the poverty line, Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable. Already, scientists and researchers are <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/bangladesh-mapping-climate-change-and-food-security">referring to</a> Bangladesh as the “ground zero” of climate change, foreshadowing the water shortages that will likely spread around the world and affect more than one billion people by 2060, <a href="http://cegis.usgs.gov/pdf/sea_level_rise_text.pdf">according to</a> the United States Geological Survey.</p>
<p>“Bangladesh stands at the forefront of saltwater contamination,” said Aneire Khan, a consultant for the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Research, Bangladesh. She was the first to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230389/">broach</a> the topic four years ago in a study conducted in Dacope, a small administrative district in coastal southwest Bangladesh. “However, the same trend potentially affects all 11 Asian large river deltas, and other major deltas, notably the Nile and the Mississippi,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_607" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-607" class="size-large wp-image-607" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-1024x683.jpg" alt="Boats docked in a coastal village (Credit: Mofizur Rahman)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-607" class="wp-caption-text">Boats docked in a coastal village (Credit: Mofizur Rahman)</p></div>
<p>When Khan visited Dacope’s local hospital, she discovered alarming rates of high blood pressure-related conditions among pregnant women which she linked to high salt content in local drinking water sources.</p>
<p>Khan and her team measured blood pressure and took urine samples from women in the community and found that the number of hypertension cases was almost eight times higher than in non-coastal regions of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>High blood pressure is among the lead causes of maternal death in developing countries, <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/">according to</a> the World Health Organisation. Heavy salt intake increases the risk for coronary heart disease, which is the single most important risk factor for stroke, Khan explained. High blood pressure also makes pregnant women particularly vulnerable to a condition called pre-eclampsia, which can lead to severe headaches, organ damage, and even death.</p>
<p>Khan’s study caught the attention of Susmita Dasgupta,<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/susmita-dasgupta"> lead environmental economist</a> for the Development Research Group at the World Bank.</p>

<p>With a team of researchers, Dasgupta began to investigate how saltwater consumption during pregnancy affects infants. She <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/02/24046975/drinking-water-salinity-infant-mortality-coastal-bangladesh">found</a> that babies whose mothers consumed saltwater during the last month of pregnancy were at risk. Indeed, their survival rates were as badly affected as by other factors known to determine infant mortality, such as a mother’s age, education and availability of toilet facilities.</p>
<p>Dasgupta also noted that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing salinity problems.</p>
<p>The rising seas and increased storm surge in coastal Bangladesh breach groundwater wells and rivers, turning these water sources salty. Even though freshwater is abundant during the monsoons, resulting in major floods, it’s the opposite during winter. As the ground dries up and rainfall peters out, salt stays behind. During this dry season, the level of salt concentration in drinking water can reach as high as eight times what is deemed safe by the World Health Organisation, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230389/">according to research</a> from Imperial College in London. This is worsened by shrimp water farming in these regions.</p>

<p>The issue is not new – communities in southwest Bangladesh have battled the rise of the ocean and violent typhoons for decades. But with each passing year, the problem worsens at an unprecedented rate. The typhoons that accompany climate change have gotten stronger, and Khan found that drinking water sources as far as 100 kilometres inland Bangladesh are turning into brine. Research <a href="http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.s.plant.201401.02.html">shows</a> that in the last 35 years, salinity in the country has increased by 26 percent, putting the 40 million people who live in coastal Bangladesh in danger.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is rapidly disappearing under the sea, and its people are increasingly forced to adapt or to simply move to parts less vulnerable to flooding and salinity.</p>
<p>Numerous NGOs and international organisations, like BRAC, Shushilan, the World Bank, and Concern International are trying to solve the issue and prevent a mass exodus of people from the coastal parts of the country.</p>

<p>There are three main ways that NGOs and the Bangladeshi government are trying to improve freshwater access in these areas, said Santanu Lahiri, a water supply and sanitation expert for the World Bank. The most traditional of these approaches involve building standing freshwater ponds, where rainwater is collected and stored for the dry season. However, this is hardly fool proof — as these ponds can remain unsheltered from the elements, the water sometimes evaporates and can be contaminated by outside sources, said Yan Zheng, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Instead, some scientists are adopting a second method, explained Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of environmental science at Vanderbilt University who has conducted extensive fieldwork on flooding in southwest Bangladesh. They are setting up aquifer recharge stations, where freshwater is pumped deep into the ground. Once there, it can be stored without risk of contamination for up to two years, said Gilligan.</p>

<p>A third method is that of reverse osmosis, added Lahiri, which removes salt from the water to make it potable. But this is an expensive and time-consuming proposition, requiring financing, proper management and regular maintenance — all things that these small communities often are unequipped with, according to Zheng.</p>
<p>In a country plagued by political instability and poverty, it may take years for solutions to spread across the region. While major NGOs and even governments like the European Union are investing into projects and research, many of these projects are still at an experimental stage. Implementation continues to prove a challenge, with limited funding, fragmented resources and difficulty in accessing the areas that are worst affected.</p>
<p>“We can&#8217;t deliver sustainable development without taking urgent action to tackle climate change and supporting the communities already suffering from its impacts,” <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-saleemul-huq/the-green-thread_b_8149614.html?ir=India&amp;adsSiteOverride=in">said</a> Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change Development in Bangladesh and a regular attendee at the international United Nations climate change meetings. “In Paris, governments can start delivering on their newly enshrined development goals.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixty two-year-old Luciano Mangaeao of Paranora in Beira, Mozambique could not hide his fear.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his hand on a sweltering afternoon and remarked dejectedly: “It’s almost rain season and I know what it means for us. It means a season of suffering; floods and storms are coming again.”</p>
<p>Though he has lived with his family in Paranora on the coast of the Indian Ocean for over three decades, the extreme weather events experienced in Beira over the past decade have left him and other residents at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>Beira, a colonial city that sprouted in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, was originally designed to accommodate 30,000 people, but today it is Mozambique’s second largest city with a population of more than 500,000. The city is a critical gateway to the sea for landlocked countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, but many of the residents live in abject poverty.</p>
<p>Experts say that tropical cyclones build up over the Indian Ocean and send water surging into Beira, inundating residential and poverty-stricken areas, many of which are below sea level. Within hours, the drainage system backs up, evacuation routes are cut off, and fecal material seeps into the fields and the food chain, even contaminating drinking water.</p>
<p>Figures from the Mozambican government reveal that between 1980 and 1993, two category three or higher cyclones hit the country, compared to seven in the period between 1994 and 2007.According to a 2013 report,<em>Assessing the Risk of Cyclone-Induced Storm Surge and Sea-level Rise in Mozambique</em>, wind risks in Beira are much higher than in the capital, Maputo. Maputo is more effectively shielded by the Madagascar land-mass, which also tends to dissipate cyclone energy, so the probability of intense wind events is much higher in Beira.</p>

<p>“During the rainy season some parts of Beira experience massive flooding and we are forced to abandon our homes and move to higher areas inland. We lose property worth thousands of dollars each season but because our lives depend on the sea we have no choice but to return after the floods,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>Some buildings have been abandoned for good and are left to slowly crumble. A deserted government building stands close to the sea, so are many others including shops and beer halls. Roads have been also been destroyed.</p>
<p>The crudely built stone, sack and sand sea walls tell a story of poverty as Beira struggles to adapt to climate change-induced calamities. Some of the sea barricades have succumbed to tropical cyclones and storms. Other parts of the barricades are slowly receding into the rising sea water.</p>
<p>The extreme weather events in Beira are beyond the comprehension of many, with some residents convinced that the apocalyptic end is nigh.</p>
<p>“No one is telling us what is happening but from the stories we hear on television the future does not look good for us,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>His fears were shared by Luiza Ferenando, an illiterate middle aged woman who lives in Storire, a neighborhood in the city.</p>
<p>“My life depends on fishing and I can’t leave this place. I have no other opportunities outside this area,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" class="size-large wp-image-266" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg" alt="Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-266" class="wp-caption-text">Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Thirty four-year-old Eduardo Fuinouto has been living in Paranora for sixteen years, selling different wares to the fishermen in Beira.</p>
<p>“When storms come our businesses come to a halt and we move to higher grounds. But our future is here and we hope our mayor will do something to serve our city and our businesses,” Fuinouto said.</p>
<p>Faustino Estacha, a twenty three-year-old university student, also remains optimistic that the mayor of Beirahas bigger plans to save the city.</p>
<p>“One of these plans is to build a sea wall which can save our homes,” he said.</p>
<p>He added: “People have nice homes and they can’t just leave but the barricades which used to be here have been destroyed by the sea water.”</p>
<p>According to Bill McKibben, a U.S.-based climate activist and founder of <em>350.org</em>, some communities facing rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions have no choice but to leave for good.</p>
<p>“Building sea walls is an option, but very expensive. The frustration is that the world seems not care. It’s a very depressing situation and some people (living on coastal areas) have to pack their bags and go,” McKibben said.</p>
<p>In the face of this growing threat, Graca Machel, a human rights activist and member of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders who work together for peace and human rights,urges coastal countries to develop programs to better assist these vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>“Countries on coastal areas should come up with policies on how to protect communities or encourage the people to move a little further from the coast,” Machel said.</p>
<p>The mayor of Beira, Daviz Simango, said more than 100,000 residents living in low lying areas in the city will have to be relocated to higher areas in the next decade.</p>

<p>He was quick to add that the city needed more than US$100 million to address climate change-induced problems, an amount that he said the city could not raise without the intervention of the private sector.</p>
<p>A Dutch engineering firm, Deltares, is working with other private companies like Witteveen +Bos, Wissing, Niras Mozambique and VandenBroek Consulting to partner with the city of Beira to develop a so-called <em>Beira Master Plan 2035 </em>and avert a full-on climate change disaster.</p>
<p>“Two important initiatives in this respect are: capacity building and institutional strengthening focused on the planning and enforcement capacity of municipality and the establishment of the Beira Land Development Company,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Simango said the Land Development Company, which will be a partnership between the city and private investors, will assist in the implementation of a new finance model where financial feasibility of the Beira Municipality and of the masterplan is increased through several business cases.</p>
<p>“The selling of dredging sand and the selling of land with road and drainage infrastructure are important income generating elements of this finance model,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Deltares senior project manager Peter Letitre said they would establish a land development company through an initial investment of up to US$20 million.</p>
<p>“A reasonable starting budget would be around US$10- $20 million. Planning capacity and financial means need to be mobilized. Besides, a better (win-win) cooperation between City and Port of Beira is very important for the economic growth of the Port and the City”.</p>
<p>According to this ambitious plan, the city needs to stop uncontrolled issuing of land to developers especially in areas which should be designated for water retention.</p>
<p>There is also a need to plan, zone and enforce land reserved for important future infrastructure projects like retention basins, drainage canals, sewage lines and roads. Assessments of the potential vulnerabilities of vital infrastructure – such as power lines, roads and railways – to flooding, and repairs of these weaknesses must also be conducted.</p>
<p>But significant obstacles to the implementation of such plans remain.</p>
<p>Land regulations in Beira are poorly enforced, which contributes to fragmented urban development. Here, speculators purchase property at low prices with the hope of later turning a profit, and are not willing to give it to the government for infrastructure projects. Because there is no incentive for these private developers to work alongside government plans, sustainable development in Beira remains just out of reach.</p>

<p>Letitre said the government must play a critical role in designating and enforcing reserved spaces for important future projects.</p>
<p>“This is a complex process for which cooperation of the inhabitants is very important. Ordinary people (in Beira) are also involved in planning of various projects such as the drainage projects in various neighborhoods, in cooperation with the authorities. They are also involved in operation and maintenance of drainage projects and solid waste projects,” Letitre said.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, Letitre remains bullish on Beira’s future. “After the master plan is successfully implemented,” he said, “Beira will be a safer, more sustainable, prosperous and beautiful city.”</p>
<p>These are hopeful words, but one thing is certain: successful implementation of the Beira Master Plan will require the participation of key stakeholders in the city or risk facing the same fate as similar plans that have come before it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mebai Warusam sits under his stilt-supported house, facing the Pacific Ocean’s turquoise waters lapping 50 metres from his front gate. At 91, born and raised on the island of Saibai in the <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/torres-strait-islands">Torres Strait</a>, he is an elder visitors and locals turn to for knowledge.</p>
<p>A few years ago, he says, researchers from down south travelled to Saibai. “They said, ‘If water comes right through this island, what you will do?’ I said, ‘I will never move from this island.’” “I will jump on my boat, tie that rope on a wongai tree. I will live here; I will die here.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1YvT1crPEf4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Patimah Waia, a teacher, underlines the point. “People are now realising that global warming [is happening] and water is rising and Saibai is low … some people, even though they realise its global warming that causes the water to rise, are so much in love with the place that they don’t want to leave.”</p>
<p>Saibai is one of more than 200 islands and coral cays that make up the Torres Strait, the archipelago straddling the waters between the northernmost tip of mainland Australia and <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/papua-new-guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. Eighteen of the strait’s islands are inhabited. For most of the island communities here, the impact of climate change is a daily reality. Coastal erosion, rising sea levels, worsening yearly floods, frightening king tides and drought are all regular occurrences.</p>
<p><a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/what-paris-climate-negotiators-are-up-against-and-what-it-means-for-australia">As Australia negotiates new global climate targets with the world’s decision-makers in Paris</a>, many in the Torres Strait hope for increased attention to the culturally and environmentally unique islands slowly sinking in Australia’s backyard. Saibai and the rest of the Torres Strait islands are officially part of Queensland.</p>

<p><a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.tsra.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2005/Current-and-Future-Climates-of-the-Torres-Strait-web.pdf">A climate report</a> published by the Torres Strait regional authority, the local Indigenous body, found sea levels in the region rose by 6mm each year from 1993 to 2010, compared with a global average of 3.22mm. The same report said the mean rate of sea level rise since the middle of the 19th century has been higher than the mean rate in the previous two millennia. For the seafaring Torres Strait islanders, the rise can mean profound lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>“Our word for home is the same as an island,” says Joseph Elu, chairman of the Torres Strait regional authority. “If that is lost, people will have nothing left. The weather patterns have changed. We usually get storms this time of the year but we haven’t had one yet.”</p>
<p>When the storms do come, so do the tides. For low-lying islands such as Saibai and Boigu in the far north of the strait, this means annual floods and inundation.</p>
<p>People here are no strangers to unexpected weather events. In the years after the second world war, a water spout inundated Saibai, drowning crops and filling wells with salt water. Fearing a repeat, in 1947 several families from the island relocated to Cape York on the Australian mainland and established villages, known today as Bamaga and Seisia.</p>
<p>Elu says his family was among those who left Saibai. Now extreme weather has become commonplace, he says. “What happened there on the one instance that water spout came down is now happening twice or three times a year in the full moon high tide months of December, January and February.”</p>

<p>Normally, rain mitigates the impact of seawater inundation by washing the soil of salt, enabling crops to grow. But this year the drought that has also hit much of <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> has brought water restrictions to including Saibai and Boigu – and fears for what might happen if it doesn’t rain soon.</p>
<p>The demand for resources on Saibai, particularly fresh water, is heightened by pressure from the coastal villages in adjacent Papua New Guinea, says John Rainbird, a climate specialist at the Torres Strait regional authority.</p>
<p>Under a treaty, communities from the two countries trade and interact with each other daily. Now the villages in Papua New Guinea have run low on water and villagers regularly come over to Saibai seeking basic services.</p>
<p>For community leaders such as Keri Akiba, the increased pressure stokes fears. “I’m really worried. Sometimes I’m sitting, just thinking that in 20 to 50 years all this place will be under water, the way it’s going,” he says. “It will be under the water most of the time, and then the sicknesses and diseases that will obviously come out of that.”</p>

<p>Rainbird was one of the architects of the Torres Strait’s climate strategy. The focus is on planning and resilience. Of course, planning is made harder by the fact nobody knows for sure just how fast the changes will happen. But one thing is sure, he says. “Anywhere that you have a problem, climate change will only make that problem worse.”</p>
<p>The Torres Strait, says Rainbird, is on the front line of climate change in Australia. Now is the time to prepare. “In 30 years’ time, the Gold Coast, Sydney and Melbourne will all be dealing with sea level impact in some way, competing for limited government resources,” Rainbird says. “We need to get in early while we can.”</p>
<p>The Torres Strait’s population pales in comparison with the coastal areas in Australia’s south. Government statistics show about 8,700 people live in the Torres Strait, while more than 40,000 Torres Strait islanders live in other parts of Australia. Initially climate change will affect only a few hundred islanders, in particular on the low-lying islands of Saibai, Boigu, Masig, Warraber and Iama.</p>

<p>Do Torres Strait islanders feel they have been forgotten? Elu smiles at the question, pointing out there is a book calling the Torres Strait islands the “forgotten isles”. Elu says the previous government dedicated funds to helping <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/vanishing-homeland-leaves-people-with-nowhere-to-go-20130211-2e8tz.html">Pacific island nations such as Kiribati</a> deal with the threat of rising sea levels, as Torres Strait islanders looked on. “Islands are sinking here,” he says.</p>
<p>Within the Torres Strait, some feel they’ve been left to fend for themselves. Explaining the impact of sea level rise on Poruma Island, councillor Phillemon Mosby says despite media and government interest, little has been done to tackle the changes. “Does anybody out there know about us, does anybody care?”</p>
<p>On the central coral cay islands of which Poruma is one, the issue is erosion rather than of salt water inundation. Large chunks of the island get swept away by tides. In some cases, the sand migrates elsewhere on the island and builds new plateaus.</p>
<p>In remote areas, climate adaptation and building resilient communities is expensive, and although Indigenous people have traditional ways of recording and adapting to changes in weather, the competition for limited funds is fierce. Although $26m has been set aside for building seawalls on Saibai, it is estimated that will barely cover more than half the front part of the island. On mud islands such as Saibai, water also comes in from the wetlands in the middle and the back, leaving the islanders with a narrow strip of land between the ocean and the swamp.</p>

(Credit: Saila Huusko)</p></div>
<p>Many locals also recognise that putting up seawalls is only a temporary solution. “You don’t want to scare the hell out of people but it’s also important that people are informed,” says Rainbird.</p>
<p>Mosby says: “When we hear warnings of tsunami and all that, people do get stressed about it. Mentally it is affecting our people.”</p>
<p>Being informed also means discussing the worst-case scenarios, including leaving the islands. But Saibai leader Keri Akiba says leaving is not an option his community is willing to consider. Leaving the island behind would mean abandoning culture, heritage and relatives buried here.</p>
<p>Akiba adds: “I hope the perpetrator governments that have got the coal power houses would decrease them so that the low-lying areas, the islands like Saibai, or even in the Pacific that we’ve seen in the news, get a little bit more time to enjoy their heritage and where they were born.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are troubled waters ahead for a Polynesia group of people within the Melanesian country of Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>With more than half a million residents, the Solomon Islands is comprised of mostly dark-skinned Melanesian people with a smaller population of fairer skinned Micronesian and Polynesians.</p>
<p>As many of these minority populations have been swallowed up by the mainstream Melanesian group on the larger islands, the remote Polynesian outliers in the archipelago Ontong Java (commonly referred to as Lord Howe by Solomon Islanders) are also being slowly consumed, but by the sea.</p>

<p>The Ontong Java group is one of the largest in the world consisting of 120 small, low coral atolls that enclose a vast lagoon extending 70 kilometers from Luaniua in the southeast to Pelau in the north.</p>
<p>Approximately 3,000 people live in both permanent and semi-permanent houses on both islands.</p>
<p>The Lord Howe Settlement in the capital of Honiara is home to some 600 people from Ontong Java Atoll who can only claim ancestral ties to the atoll, but have no permanent home.</p>
<p>These residents are susceptible to sea level rise, tsunami, heat waves and other natural disasters like cyclones. But even more troubles lie ahead for those who could be forced to leave their homes from the natural intrusion of the rising Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Their traditional food sources like swamp taro, potato, coconut and other fruit trees are being threatened by the current El Nino -induced drought. Over-fishing and extraction of sea resources like sea cucumber for commercial use by local residents means sea food and marine lives are also becoming scarce.</p>
<p>Root crops such as swamp taro are dying due to salt-water infiltrating into the land, which is no more than three meters above sea level.</p>

<p>Their strong attachment to the land, sea, family and culture could be destroyed by the very ocean they depended on for thousands of years, as well as from normal occurrences such as tropical cyclones on this remote part of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Government intervention so far has been through the subsidization of shipping costs for basic food items like rice, biscuits, sugar and needed fuel for fishing boat engines.</p>
<p>On the regional level, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) initiated the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) project, mainly focused on exploring food security for the Ontong Javans.</p>
<h2>Canary in the coal mine</h2>
<p>In many ways, atoll residents are the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the Soloman Islands archipelago when it comes to natural disasters. They are the first to be affected by the rising threats of climate change.</p>
<p>Adaptation measures under PACC such as new methods of farming and packaging of local food sources have received some coverage, but it’s the question of ‘relocation’ that has dominated mainstream discourses on a national and regional level. The Ontong Java Atoll and other low-lying islands in the Pacific Ocean such as Tuvalu and Kiribati face common threats from climate-induced impacts on their environment and livelihoods.</p>

<p>Work is underway on a national climate change policy, according to Dr. Melchoir Mataki, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Disaster Management and Meteorology (MECDM). “The current government made it a priority for us to develop a climate change legislation,” he said. “Preparatory work on the draft legislation has been completed and this will be further advanced in 2016.”</p>
<p>Mataki acknowledged that the issue of relocation is often perceived as a last option, but for many parts of the country it’s becoming the only “reasonable” option left. “[It] cannot be postponed any longer,” he said,” however relocation is a sensitive and delicate matter because it touches a variety of contentious issues such as land tenure and finance.”</p>
<p>“[It’s] not only about the physical relocation of people and their properties,” Mataki added, “but also entails political, social, economic and cultural shifts and losses for people who will move and those who will receive them.” For these reasons, he said the government is focusing on identifying the country’s most vulnerable populations in order to come up with appropriate relocation guidelines. Responsibility for this task has fallen to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey (MLH&amp;S).</p>
<p>Relocation may be the only solution for the people of Ontong Java Atoll in the near future, but it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Scott Leckie who currently serves as the director of Displacement Solutions, a Geneva-based NGO working to assist people who are displaced from their homes due to conflict or climate change shared similar sentiments.</p>
<div id="attachment_563" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-563" class="size-large wp-image-563" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1024x579.jpg" alt="The beautiful coast is slowly eroding (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="430" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-300x170.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-672x380.jpg 672w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1020x577.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-563" class="wp-caption-text">The beautiful coast is slowly eroding (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>“Our position is essentially that no one should ever be forced to move from their traditional homes and land,” he said,” and that if planned relocation is contemplated, that this must be voluntary and wholly-driven by the people themselves, supported by a large majority of those to relocate, and be relocated to a place of the community&#8217;s choosing.”</p>
<p>Leckie, who was born in Los Angeles with Netherlands citizenship and currently resides in Australia said planned relocation processes should be guided by the Peninsula Principles on Climate Displacement Within States (2013) and appropriate, detailed and adequately funded planning must precede any actual movement of people.</p>
<p>“As with all citizens from Ontong Java, the people of the atoll have rights and any relocation must be a right-based approach which respects, preserves and improves their human rights in the process,” he said.</p>
<p>Some residents have gone on record to say that is relocation becomes necessary, they would choose to move to Isabel Province, which is larger than the province under which they are currently governed as part of the Malaita Outer Islands (MOI).</p>
<p>In such cases, Leckie said that intensive work should be done with host communities near the relocation site to ensure a smooth transition. “A successful of relocation is extremely difficult, but it can work if all parties work together to make it work,” he noted.</p>
<p>His firm, Displacement Solutions, has experience on the ground in Ontong Java. Their photojournalist Beni Knight spend two months on the atoll this year documenting the ongoing challenges faced by residents. Relocation, Leckie said, appears all but certain. “Land is eroding fast, some villages have already disappeared, crops are ever more difficult to grow,” he said. “If relocation is the option the people of Ontong Java choose, this will be particularly difficult for older people, many of whom will not want to leave and who may have never or very rarely ever left the atoll before.”</p>
<div id="attachment_561" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-561" class="size-large wp-image-561" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1024x643.jpg" alt="A section of the atoll's coastline (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="477" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1024x643.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-300x188.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1020x641.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-561" class="wp-caption-text">A section of the atoll&#8217;s coastline (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>When it comes to climate displacement, experts say that people face a difficult choice: stay and adapt, move as a community in a planned manner, or migrate on a person by person or family by family basis. “We generally favor relocation over migration as it is organized, well thought-out, and planned,” Leckie said. “It has the best chance of preserving the unique cultures that so many people of the islands live with and cherish so much.”</p>
<p>Equally vulnerable are Ontong Javans residing in the heart of capital Honiara in the Lord Howe Settlement. The Settlement is located beside the river and coast of Mataniko River delta.</p>
<p>A United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment in 2014 noted the Settlement has an area of 2.8 hectares with a population of 631–295 men and 336 women. According to the report, there is a population density of 223 persons per hectare, “the highest among the hotspots studied…packed with houses spaced closely together.”</p>
<p>Doctorate student Coggan Kuare, who left the Solomon Islands to study at Hokkaido University in Japan, said the Settlement itself needs relocating as the devastating floods of April 2014 which killed more than 20 people indicate that climate change poses great risk to the settlers.</p>
<p>“Flooding from Mataniko River, sea level rise and tsunami are the greatest threats to the Ontong Java settlers of Lord Howe Settlement,” said Kuare whose is working on the thesis “Disposition, Expansion and Relocation of Honiara City.”</p>
<h2>Hoping for change</h2>
<p>With world leaders gathered in Paris for the United Nations (UN) climate negotations, the plight of Ontong Javans both on the atoll and Lord Howe Settlement cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>This year Reverend Nigel Kelaepa, a prominent Ontong Javan is observing the negotiations in Paris. It’s his first time at such a high level climate event.</p>
<p>The issue of relocation may appear insignificant to some, but reducing global greenhouse gas emissions could save the Ontong Javans from the rising sea level. Led by Samuel Manetoali from the Minister of Environment, Climate Change and Disaster and Meteorology (MECDM), the Solomon Islands delegation to Paris has joined other small island states to lobby for the reduction of the global greenhouse gases.</p>
<div id="attachment_557" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-557" class="size-large wp-image-557" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-1024x571.jpg" alt="Local residents say they're worried that their plight is invisible to world leaders gathered in Paris (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="424" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-1024x571.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-300x167.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-1020x568.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-557" class="wp-caption-text">Local residents say they&#8217;re worried that their plight is invisible to world leaders gathered in Paris (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>“We want an ambitious and legally binding agreement within the context of the UNFCCC that obliges major emitters to reduce their emissions to restrain global temperature change to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius, treats loss and damage as a distinct element of the agreement separate from adaptation, recognizes the special case of the most vulnerable parties such as the Solomon Islands, and fast tracks financial and technical resources in the most transparent, accessible and ‘non-loan’ modalities to meet our adaptation and mitigation needs,” said Dr. Mataki, MECDM’s Permanent Secretary.</p>
<p>In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted to the UNFCCC, the Solomon Islands pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12% below 2015 levels by 2025 and 30% below 2015 levels by 2030. With international assistance, the Solomon Islands can reduce its emissions by more than 50% by 2050, but Mataki said the pledges of major emitters have fallen short. “Global action to address climate change must not leave anyone behind,” he said, “it must be inclusive as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Politics aside, the people of Ontong Java bear little responsibility for the rising seas, but residents are looking to world leaders to address the root causes of their plight before their island home disappears under their feet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amount of water is incomprehensible. We’ve been flying for hours, and just when we’re about as far from a landmass as you can possibly get—a spot where the curving, wave-flecked Pacific Ocean stretches thousands of kilometers in every direction—an island slides into view. It’s no more than a snippet of sand and palm trees, a snake winding through the blue plain of the Pacific. Fanning out around it are 1,200 similar islands, some inhabited, others not, arranged into a constellation of 29 atolls like stars in a universe of ocean. For every square kilometer of land in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, there are 10,732 square kilometers of ocean.</p>
<p>Roughly 2,000 years ago, voyagers sailing outrigger canoes discovered these smudges of land, and their descendants stayed, becoming the best navigators in the Pacific. While other cultures relied largely on the stars to find their way, Marshallese supplemented their astrological knowledge with an intricate understanding of wave dynamics and ocean currents. Boys floated on their backs for hours, memorizing the patterns beneath them. Later, far from home, they determined their location simply by the motion of the waves.</p>
<div id="attachment_144" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144" class="size-large wp-image-144" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-1024x825.jpg" alt="An aerial view of Majuro, the capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Credit: Krista Langlois)" width="760" height="612" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-1024x825.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-300x242.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P9281042-e1448482253193-993x800.jpg 993w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-144" class="wp-caption-text">An aerial view of Majuro, the capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Credit: Krista Langlois)</p></div>
<p>Even on land, Marshallese life is defined by the ocean. Since few plants grow in the sandy soil, the majority of food is harvested offshore; Marshallese contains 50 different words and phrases for fishing techniques. The foods that do come from land—breadfruit, taro, the fruit of the spiky pandanus plant—are often fermented or preserved for seafaring journeys. Even the language is born of the sea: instead of using “right” and “left” to give directions on land, the islanders use “ocean-side” (the outer edge of the atoll) and “lagoon-side” (the protected interior).</p>
<p>For generations, Marshallese called their home Aelõñ Kein Ad—“these islands of ours.” A few ships passed by, but the islands’ culture evolved in relative isolation until 1857, when the first wave of outsiders arrived: Christian missionaries bearing clothing, disease, and religion.</p>
<p>By the Second World War, Japan had taken over the islands to use as a strategic base. The outer islands were bombed by Allied forces for 75 days. Blood seeped into the sand. And when the war was over and the islands ceded to US control, nuclear testing began. Between 1946 and 1958, the United States detonated 67 atomic bombs on the Marshall Islands—the equivalent power of 1.6 Hiroshimas a day for 12 years straight. Islands were permanently despoiled and entire communities forced into exile on other, less livable, islands. Cancer rates increased, and miscarriages and previously unknown birth defects became common.</p>
<p>Through all of this, Marshallese culture adapted and survived. But today, it’s facing the one battle that might be impossible to win. Climate experts predict that because of rising sea levels caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the Marshall Islands could be uninhabitable by the end of this century.</p>
<p>As the ocean seeps into homes and buckles roads, it’s shifting from a source of inspiration to one of fear. Some Marshallese have already started to plan for relocation. Yet unlike other climate refugees—people from the island nation of Kiribati buying backup land in Fiji, for example, or the family from Tuvalu seeking climate refugee status in New Zealand—the Marshallese know exactly where they’ll go. An agreement that came into force when the Marshall Islands gained independence in 1986 allows any citizen to live and work in the United States indefinitely, without a visa or green card.</p>

<p>By the year 2100, it’s conceivable that climate change will force the entire population of the Marshall Islands to US shores. Already, more than 25,000 Marshallese—over a third of the population—have left the islands, many in the last 15 years. Among them was Sarah Joseph, now 22 and a resident of Enid, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Like Sarah, a surprising number of Marshallese migrants wind up landlocked in rural America, far from the ocean that’s shaped every aspect of their culture. Which raises the question: can Marshallese traditions and language survive without the sea? Or, in the words of the Marshallese minister of foreign affairs Tony deBrum, will climate change amount to cultural genocide?</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2006, I arrived on the remote Marshallese atoll of Ebon to teach English for a year. Sarah was the oldest daughter of the family I lived with, and one of my eighth grade students. She was smart and spunky, with a wide grin and dark hair in a floppy bun atop her head.</p>
<p>There’s no telephone or electricity on Ebon, and only one store offering rice, flour, Kool-Aid, and Spam. But sometimes, when even the one road running the length of the island began to feel too crowded, Sarah would take a boat across the 100-square-kilometer lagoon to a tiny island called Demdol, where her grandfather lived alone in a one-room shack. She’d stay for weeks, on a patch of sand no bigger than a football field, reading a Marshallese Bible, scrubbing laundry on a washboard, and collecting eggs from the chickens that pecked beneath the palms.</p>
<p>When I first met Sarah, she had just returned from Demdol. It was late August, and the days were unbearably hot. But evenings—when the sun slipped over the edge of the lagoon and the breeze rustled the palms and a string of coconut-shell fires glowed like jewels along a ribbon of land—evenings were everything I imagined living on a Pacific island would be. Sometimes Sarah would lounge in the hammock behind her parents’ house, strumming a beat-up ukulele and watching as the darkening lagoon mirrored the star-choked sky until the difference between the two became indistinguishable. It was as if we were sitting in a bowl of stars. As her mother, Rakki, stoked the fire, Sarah’s father, Jola—having spent the day cracking coconuts, drying the meat in the sun, and packing it into burlap sacks to sell for just a few dimes per kilogram—would slide his wooden skiff into the lagoon to fish.</p>
<p>Most nights, we’d already be asleep by the time Jola returned with the next day’s protein. But occasionally, if a child in the village was turning one, Sarah, Rakki, and I would join a handful of other women and walk by moonlight to the mother’s hut to sing to the child.</p>
<p>In the Marshall Islands, a first birthday is a significant milestone, and its celebration—which is much bigger than a wedding or funeral—is a remnant of the time when infant mortality was high.</p>
<p>The event begins at midnight, with a chorus of women singing to the child, and concludes days later with a traditional feast attended by the whole village. On outer islands like Ebon, the food is often served in baskets woven from palm fronds, piled with fried donuts, balls of rice, sea turtle, fish, pork, taro, breadfruit, pandanus, and more. Instead of bringing a gift, attendees take something from the host family—a pair of sandals, perhaps, or a frypan—and carry it home. The less the host family is left with, the greater their generosity. It’s a testament to the strength of the Marshallese community, an understanding that no matter how little you have, you’ll be cared for.</p>
<p>This was the world Sarah lived in for the first 14 years of her life. Looking back, it was paradise.</p>

<p>But opportunities on Ebon are few, and the school only goes to eighth grade. Students from outer islands who pass a national exam and want to go to high school have to leave home, often staying in dormitories or with relatives in Majuro, the islands’ capital. Many never return. From 2006 to 2011, 17 of 26 outer islands experienced dramatic population loss, while Majuro’s population increased by 1,770, to about 28,000.</p>
<p>Yet although Majuro offers education and jobs not available on outer islands, life there presents its own set of challenges. The reefs have been overfished or damaged by development—Majuro residents eat an average of 71.5 kilograms of fish per year, compared to 147 kilograms on the outer islands. Processed, imported foods make up the difference, but they cost money, and there isn’t enough paid work to go around. On any given afternoon, countless young men lean against buildings or lie on cool cement floors, smoking cigarettes and passing time. Each year, hundreds of Marshallese leave the outer islands for Majuro, and, each year, hundreds more leave Majuro for the United States.</p>
<p>Sarah was among the few who would have been content to stay on Ebon. She dislikes cities and crowds of people. She likes swimming in the translucent turquoise lagoon and singing on Sundays at the little blue-and-white Protestant church on the edge of the sea. But Rakki and Jola wanted more for her. By the time Sarah graduated from eighth grade, seven out of Rakki’s nine siblings lived in the Unites States. One day, the family got word that a sister would buy Sarah a one-way ticket to “Amedka.”</p>
<p>It was late spring, 2008. Sarah sat at the edge of Ebon’s narrow landing strip, wedged between the lagoon and the ocean. She watched for the white speck of an airplane to materialize in the blinding blue sky. She tried not to cry.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like most Marshallese in the United States, Sarah didn’t move because of climate change. She moved because of a lack of opportunities, and because her family said it was best. Back then, in 2008, climate change was still a phrase that few people in the Marshall Islands had heard.</p>
<p>But Sarah’s timing couldn’t have been better. That December, the highest tides of the year coalesced with a massive storm, and three-meter waves swamped the Marshall Islands. Staple crops like taro and breadfruit were ruined, roads and seawalls washed out, and knee-high seawater surged into people’s homes. Graveyards flooded and tombs were destroyed.</p>
<p>As with the world’s other low-lying atoll nations, Kiribati and the Maldives, the Marshall Islands have always been susceptible to floods and typhoons. Archaeologist Marshall Weisler calls low coral atolls “the most precarious landscapes for human habitation,” bar none. One flood in 1979 became so legendary in the Marshall Islands that elders told and retold stories of the ocean coming into their homes while they slept, waves battering their walls. The 2008 flood was intense, but many wrote it off as a similar freak event, the kind of natural disaster that visits the region every few decades.</p>
<p>Except that the following year, in 2009, it happened again. And again. “Inundation events,” as they’re now euphemistically known, are no longer once-in-a-lifetime occasions. For the past few years, they’ve swamped vulnerable neighborhoods at least biannually and sometimes even more frequently, usually during the highest tides of the year. Sea levels in the western Pacific have risen by an estimated five centimeters per decade since the 1950s, and rainfall in Majuro has decreased by over a centimeter per decade. Droughts have become more frequent, too. The lack of rainwater—which people depend on to fill drinking water catchments and irrigate crops—is almost as troubling as rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Mark Stege, executive director of the Marshall Islands Conservation Society at the College of the Marshall Islands, explains that alone, the Marshallese could withstand any one of these events. But stacked atop one another, there’s a threshold: a point at which people decide that the risk of property damage, the health and safety of their children, and the stress of living in fear, overpower the desire to stay on land that’s been handed down for generations, with their family and culture intact.</p>
<p>Stege is creating models to determine where, exactly, that threshold lies. How much flood risk is too much? How many floods per year are too many? Though he hasn’t yet come up with an answer, he feels certain there will come a time when the Marshall Islands are no longer habitable. There won’t be a sudden exodus, a single moment, but over years or even decades, people will reach their personal threshold and leave.</p>

<p>No one I spoke to knows anyone who’s yet left the country because of climate change. But the country’s first climate refugees may not be far off. When the US government bombed the Marshallese island of Bikini in the 1940s and 1950s—in the name of nuclear testing—the people who lived there were given a trust fund to help them relocate. Most were forced onto the barren island of Kili, one of the few spots in the Marshall Islands without a lagoon, a feature that buffers islands from the crashing waves. Because of this inadequacy, the island is particularly vulnerable to flooding, so Bikinians are petitioning the US Congress to use the trust fund to buy land in the United States. The fund set up to help them survive nuclear testing may now help them survive climate change instead.</p>
<p>Yet the government refuses to consider a similar solution for the entire country. Doing so is akin to admitting defeat, and the Marshallese aren’t ready for that. Not yet. Undeterred, Minister deBrum travels the world, telling leaders and politicians that climate change can be reversed, that reducing greenhouse emissions can save the Marshall Islands from becoming a country of abandoned buildings being slowly devoured by salt and coconut crabs.</p>
<p>Instead of seeking asylum, the Marshallese are embracing their heritage, clinging to the essence of what makes them islanders. Traditional tattoo designs mimicking the patterns of fish scales and ocean waves have become popular after decades of disuse. A program called <em>Jaki-ed </em>is reviving the art of weaving fine clothing mats from pandanus leaves. Stege is creating a digital Noah’s Ark, a record of plants and fish whose names could be lost. And more than 300 teens and young adults have graduated from a program called <em>Waan Ael</em><em>õñ</em> <em>in Majel</em> that teaches them to build and sail dugout outrigger canoes. The program’s director, Alson Kelen, sailed one more than 3,800 kilometers, from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands, using only traditional navigation. A storm chased him for the entire three-week journey.</p>
<p>But while cultural preservation and calls for climate action are vital to maintaining Marshall Islanders’ sense of identity, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves little hope that such measures will be more than stopgaps. Mary-Elena Carr, a biological oceanographer with Columbia University, explains that even if carbon emissions stopped tomorrow, the lengthy lifespan of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that warming trends will continue unabated for the next 1,000 years. The official IPCC estimate is that global sea levels will rise between 26 and 98 centimeters by 2100, and Carr thinks even that is conservative. “I find it extremely unlikely that global average sea level rise will be below one meter by 2100,” she says. Either way, much of the Marshall Islands will be submerged.</p>

<p>From his office in downtown Majuro, which features a floor-to-ceiling photograph of an atomic bomb exploding over Bikini, Bikini’s acting mayor Wilson Note says that he knows not everyone agrees with his peoples’ decision to prepare for exodus. But Bikinians were already robbed of their homeland once. Moving to the United States won’t be much of a stretch. “Kili is dangerous now,” Note says. “Big waves come and wash over the island. We are very proud because we are the very first in the Marshall Islands to think about moving out of the Marshall Islands. We are the leaders.”</p>
<p>When I ask where they might go, he shrugs. “Maybe Hawaii. Maybe Oklahoma.”</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s a sea surrounding Oklahoma, too, but instead of a wave-flecked plain of blue, it’s a sea of farmland, a grid of fields punctuated by grain silos and pump jacks. One in five jobs in Oklahoma is supported—directly or indirectly—by the oil and natural gas industries, and as of last year, roughly 55 percent of adults in Enid, Oklahoma believed global warming is real. The national average is 63 percent.</p>
<p>Oklahoma is also the fifth most popular state for Marshallese migrants (after Arkansas, Hawaii, Washington, and California), and it’s where Sarah moved after living with her aunt for six years in Arkansas and graduating from high school there. Though Enid seems like an improbable place for Pacific Islanders to settle, it is, in a way, familiar. The first Marshallese came here with missionaries about 40 years ago, and wrote home about the jobs that could be had in meat-processing factories, and the public schools their children could attend. Eventually, family joined family.</p>
<p>I went to Enid to trace Sarah’s journey, and after settling into a sketchy motel between the Korean Church of Grace and the Wild Childs Gentlemen’s Club, I visited Enid High School, where Sarah’s cousin Ashlyn Joash works as a liaison between the school district and the Marshallese community. Ashlyn translates teachers’ notes for Marshallese parents who don’t speak English, and explains to teachers why their Marshallese students struggle with punctuality and grades. Her hope, she says, is to help Oklahomans understand who the islanders in their midst are and where they came from. (Case in point, when I told Enid High principal Jim Beierschmitt, who oversees 150 Marshallese students, out of 1,810, that I’d recently been to Majuro, he asked, “Now, where’s that?”)</p>
<p>Five years ago, the Marshallese population in Enid was 1,000. Today, it may be as high as 2,000, and is expected to double again in 10 years. Yet, though Marshallese are legal workers who gladly take undesirable, low-paying jobs, Enid hasn’t exactly welcomed them. “It’s a redneck state and we have a bad name here,” Ashlyn says later. “You hear a lot of ‘Go back where you came from, go back to the Marshall Islands!’” (Ashlyn was born and raised in Oklahoma.)</p>

<p>In 2009, Oklahoma passed legislation that English would be the only language option for driving tests. Federal social benefits such as health insurance are unavailable to Marshallese migrants who aren’t citizens. Terry Mote, Micronesian community health coordinator for the Garfield County Health Department, told me his elderly mother caught pneumonia and was hospitalized soon after he brought her to Oklahoma. Without Medicare, her bill came to $10,000. He worked two jobs to pay it off.</p>
<p>But there are also signs that things are improving. One teacher, Rita Hartwick, traveled to the Marshall Islands to learn basic weaving and cooking, and is now bringing that knowledge to her home economics classes. And after English as a Second Language teacher Jennifer Patterson noticed that Marshallese students—even with the ubiquitous skinny jeans and smartphones of American high schools—still strolled between classes strumming ukuleles and Skyped their families in Majuro to sing for children’s first birthdays, she organized a Marshallese choir to “highlight all the positive things they do.” The choir has already sung for the president of the Marshall Islands when he visited, and has been invited to sing at the Oklahoma governor’s office this Christmas. The morning I’m there, they sing their national anthem to me in Marshallese:</p>
<p>“My island lies o’er the ocean / Like a wreath of flowers upon the sea…” Their voices rise and swell. If I close my eyes, the fluorescent-lit room becomes my classroom in Ebon, humid, the salty smell of the ocean drifting through open windows. “I’ll never leave my dear home sweet home / God of our forefathers, protect and bless forever the Marshall Islands!”</p>
<p>Later, some of the students in the choir tell me they’re Bikinian and that their parents, already displaced by nuclear testing, were among the first immigrants to Enid. Because many have been unable to save enough for the $2,000 plane ticket back to Majuro, their children have never seen the ocean. When I mention I’ve been to the Marshall Islands some of the students ask, in awe, “Did you swim in the ocean? What was it like?”</p>
<hr />
<p>That Sunday, I see some of the same teenagers at the Marshallese First Assembly of God, singing Marshallese hymns and dancing beneath palm-frond weavings that look like sea turtles and the swirls of waves. After the service, there’s a party, but the only seafood to serve the guests of honor is some sort of fried fish brought in a cooler from Oklahoma City. So the pastor’s two adult granddaughters grab $40 from the collection plate, and I drive them down the road to an all-you-can-eat Asian buffet. There, the two Marshallese women, their tropical-colored muumuus standing out in a crowd of Midwestern farmers and roughnecks, fill take-out containers with steamed mussels. We joke sadly that this is fishing in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Sarah moved from Arkansas to Enid in 2013 when she got a scholarship to attend a community college. She lived with her cousin Ashlyn’s family in a crowded, dingy apartment on the west side of town. She wanted to study criminal justice. But one semester in, when she was 20, Sarah found herself pregnant.</p>
<p>Carrying a child revived the debilitating homesickness she’d experienced in those first years away from Ebon. She missed the ocean more than ever, the smell of the coconut oil women rub into their hair, the wind in the palm trees, the cook fires burning in the night. She craved the fish Jola would bring home on a strand of fishing line, the pickled papaya Rakki made. Some weeks, the only thing in Oklahoma Sarah could stomach were chocolate shakes from McDonald’s. One day she drank 12.</p>
<p>And then, on October 2, 2014, Sarah gave birth to a daughter, Marla Armonie Moana Lanwi. Like most Marshallese women, she didn’t cry out once while in labor.</p>
<p>Sarah and her boyfriend, Nimo, who grew up in Majuro, were determined that Marla would celebrate her first birthday in the Marshall Islands. Nimo worked overtime at a meat-processing plant in Enid for a year to save enough for two round-trip tickets. So in March, when Marla was six months old, Sarah carried her onto a plane bound for the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<div id="attachment_147" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA051246.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147" class="size-large wp-image-147" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA051246-1024x768.jpg" alt="Sarah holds her daughter, Marla Armoine Moana Lanwi.

<p>When they were almost as far away from a landmass as you can possibly get, Sarah held her daughter to the airplane window so she could see, improbably, a ribbon of sand and palm trees snaking through the ocean: Aelõñ Kein Ad. These islands of ours.</p>
<p>“Tell them,” writes Marshallese poet Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner. “Tell them that we are nothing without our islands.”</p>
<p>Sarah is not a poet. She’s not a climate advocate. She’s an average Marshallese woman doing her best to help her daughter understand that she is descended from the greatest seafarers the world has ever known. But later this year, after six months in the Marshall Islands, Marla—like so many Marshallese—will leave. By the time the next king tides beat against the flimsy seawalls and wash into people’s homes, she’ll be back in Oklahoma. Unlike many Marshallese-Americans of her generation, though, Marla will later be able to say that once, she knew the ocean. She sat on her mother’s lap at the edge of the lagoon and felt the tropical water tickle her legs. She took her first steps in her paternal grandparents’ gecko-green house that rises from the sea on a piece of land sprouted from oil drums and old tires. She looked into the eyes of the sea turtle that the men speared for her first birthday feast. And, the night before her first birthday, just before midnight, she watched quietly, her brown eyes wide, as a chorus of women and children streamed into the house strumming ukuleles and singing, welcoming her to the world. To her home.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abdullah Salam walks up and down his narrow plot, tossing fistfuls of wheat seeds with a light flick of his wrist as the soil squishes beneath his bare feet. “<em>Elhamdullillah,</em>” he says—praise God—a strong rain just came through and softened the ground. A month ago, this earth was as hard as asphalt.</p>
<p>These days, it feels to Salam like his soil is fighting him. It’s quick to dry out, turning hard and gray. The seeds don’t seem to like it: No matter how much money he spends on fertilizers, he’s getting slightly lower yields every harvest. And no matter how much he irrigates the land, it’s always thirsty. Always.</p>
<div id="attachment_33" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33" class="size-large wp-image-33" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="A thin white film on the sun-scorched earth in a field betrays the reason for dying crops; salt.

<p>But there’s nothing to be done about it, and there’s no one to complain to here in Kafr el-Sheikh, in the center of Egypt’s Nile Delta, so Salam carries on planting. He, his wife and his 15-year-old son, Mohammed, scatter the wheat seeds around his 2-acre field. Their neighbor then drives his tractor through it, tilling the soil and pushing the seeds deep into the ground. Once that’s done, they all have tea and wait.</p>
<p>“The harvest will be in five or six months, <em>inshallah</em> [God willing],” Salam says. “One [acre] used to yield 18 or 20 <em>ardab</em> [worth about $1000]. But now we’ll probably only get 10.” Salam will sell half of that at market for about $250, and the other half his wife will mill into flour and bake into bread. But it’s nearly impossible to make such a small amount of flour stretch until the next harvest, she says.</p>
<p>This land, where the Nile spreads out to meet the sea, once grew enough wheat to feed everyone from Cairo to Rome—the breadbasket of the world, they called it. Today, the delta barely feeds the farmers who cultivate it. Salam blames his diminishing returns on rising fertilizer prices and bad luck.</p>
<p>But it’s not bad luck—it’s the sea. It’s warming, rising and expanding onto the low-lying, delta lands and seeping into the water that feeds them. By the end of the century, <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">60 percent</a> of the delta region—including Salam’s field—will be so saturated with salt as to be barely farmable. As much as <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">20 percent</a> of this once-fertile land will be covered in water. When this happens, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/21/climate-change-nile-flooding-farming">two-thirds</a> of Egypt’s food will drown and two-thirds of the country’s <a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/10/10873/2013/hessd-10-10873-2013-print.pdf">population</a> will be left homeless and hungry.</p>
<h2><strong>The salt shakedown<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Sadek Mahmoud has been working the plot next to Salam’s for 65 years. He remembers when the Nile used to flood his irrigation canals every year with clear, nutrient-rich water. “I used to drink from the Nile right here. And I never ever got sick,” Mahmoud says.</p>
<p>For centuries, farmers relied solely on the Nile to water their cropland, digging a complex network of irrigation canals to connect the entire delta region to the river and its tributaries. But as Egypt’s population has soared, so has its water consumption; and as factories, power plants and megacities have emerged along the Nile’s banks, the clear, rich water of Mahmoud’s youth has been fouled by all manner of human, chemical and industrial waste. Nowadays, by the time the Nile reaches Salam and Mahmoud’s fields, it has been reduced to a brown, toxic trickle.</p>
<p>To compensate, the farmers in the area have dug a well. Salam and Mahmoud, along with about a dozen of their neighbors, take turns running a fuel-powered pump to flood their respective irrigation canals with water from the <a href="https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mXCqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;dq=nile+delta+aquifer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CNUqnxVmFP&amp;sig=fo96poV9yBUodDFZBBUGOBJwKC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI2uuoy6WDyQIVzLIUCh3vAQ8N#v=onepage&amp;q=nile%20delta%20aquifer&amp;f=false">Nile Delta aquifer</a>, a massive underground reservoir, spanning from Cairo to the Mediterranean Sea.  On the surface, this seems like a good solution to the delta’s water shortage problem, but this sort of pumping is accelerating the region’s demise, according to Badr Mabrouk, a hydrology professor at Zagazig University. “When you draw the water up from the deep aquifers, it creates pressure and it draws the sea in,” Mabrouk said.</p>
<p>Rising sea levels had already put the Nile Delta aquifer in peril before farmers began deep-well pumping, Mabrouk explained, but they have made it worse. The way coastal aquifers work is that they meet and hold back the sea underground at a point called the transition zone: The higher density saltwater sinks and gets pulled back toward the ocean and the freshwater remains on top. As long as sea levels—and aquifer levels—remain stable, this meeting point doesn’t move.</p>
<p>But if either the sea rises or the fresh water recedes, this point moves farther inland: The sea advances underground. In the case of the Nile Delta, both are happening and they’re happening quickly, Mabrouk said. As the ocean warms and its waters expand, sea levels in Egypt are rising, and the land is sinking at a rate of 0.1 inches per year as a result, according to the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa Program</a>. Meanwhile, excessive pumping is draining the aquifer faster than rainfall can refill it.</p>

<p>Climate scientists and geologists have been warning of the danger of saltwater intrusion in Egypt’s Delta for decades. But in a country riven with political upheaval and economic insecurity, the environment has never been the government’s priority—and still isn’t, according to Hassan Husseiny, a water management specialist for the American University in Cairo’s <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Sustainability/Rise/Pages/Home.aspx">Research Institute for Sustainable Environment</a>. “Studies say climate change could begin to have a real effect after 20 years,” Husseiny says. “The government doesn’t look that far ahead.”</p>
<p>But up in the northern Delta region, sea-level rise is no longer a matter of looking ahead: On a daily basis, the sea is pounding away at the populous cities of Alexandria, Damietta and Port Said. If the sea rises by even 20 inches (which <a href="http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise">a 2014 National Climate Assessment</a> projects will likely occur by 2100) <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">30 percent of Alexandria</a>, a city of 5 million, will be inundated.</p>
<p>In the popular coastal resort town of Baltim, about 30 miles north of Kafr el-Sheikh, mango farmer Mossad Abu Ghali has seen the sea advancing. “I remember when they had to build a new boardwalk because the old one got ruined by the sea,” Abu Ghali says. “That was a long time ago though. Inshallah, the sea is not advancing anymore.” Baltim built a seawall in 1992 out of large, concrete tetrapod blocks. This has slowed—but not stopped—the sea’s advance. This type of structure, known as a <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/statclim/whatcanbedone.html">revetment</a>, has an average life span of 30 to 50 years. Already the wall is half-buried in sand.</p>
<p>All along the coast, cities and towns like Baltim have constructed sea walls to try and hold back the water, but even with these measures in place, Husseiny predicted that no fewer than 10 million people would be displaced in the next 30 years.</p>
<h2><strong>The Delta’s eleventh hour</strong></h2>
<p>In 1972, Egypt launched the Coastal Research Institute (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Coastal-Research-Institute-Cori-436770736371496/info/?tab=overview">CORI</a>) to “monitor and protect” the Egyptian coast, but to date, its work has focused far more on monitoring than protecting. “There has yet to be any action taken in the delta that I know of,” Husseiny said. “There have been conferences and meetings and discussions but no action.”</p>
<p>The institute’s current flagship program is a joint venture started in 2009 with the United Nations Development Program and Global Environment Facility. The project is to create “<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/dam/egypt/docs/Environment%20and%20Energy/Climate%20Change%20Project%20Document.pdf">integrated coastal zone management systems</a>” on Egypt’s coasts by building sea barriers out of natural materials. Six years and <a href="http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/sccf-czm-egypt">$4 million later</a>, they have managed to “select a pilot site,” design an “adaptation technique” and solicit bids from contractors to work on a pilot site—but have <a href="http://www.eg.undp.org/content/egypt/en/home/operations/projects/environment_and_energy/project_sample.html">yet to build</a> a single sea barrier.</p>
<p>Aymen el-Gamal, CORI’s deputy director, works out of an office less than half a mile from the sea, and he doesn’t deny the sea levels are rising. But, he says, there is little use in trying to predict the rate at which it will rise—and there’s no sense in planning more  than one or two years ahead. Most existing models are just alarmist and unhelpful, el-Gamal says. He’s also unconvinced human-induced climate change is real. “The Earth is very clever. It can take in energy and emit it,” el-Gamal says. “There are those who say there is the greenhouse effect and the ozone—no, the Earth is bigger than all of this.” His smile is confident and kind. “So the climate change from my point of view is a normal phenomenon.” Which is why he sees his role as one of simply monitoring sea-level rise and adapting to the data as it comes in.</p>
<p>For farmers like Salam, Mahmoud and Abu Ghali, however, that won’t work. The hour is late for the delta. “The land is slowly, slowly running out of time,” Mabrouk said. Egypt’s primary food source is sinking into the sea while its government—and the international community—watches on.</p>

<p>Global leaders are gearing up for the landmark COP21 climate change summit in Paris, where they are hoping to reach consensus on a new set of regulations for greenhouse gas emissions to replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2020. But even the most aggressive of global reforms won’t do a thing to save Egypt’s Nile Delta. Even if global leaders succeed in their goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (an ambitious goal to begin with), the seas are expected to continue rising for decades to come, according to a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/071615-international-report-confirms-2014-was-earths-warmest-year-on-record.html">report</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.</p>
<p>Land loss and damage from climate change are on the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/session/9057.php">agenda</a> for the summit, but it’s unlikely that Egypt’s case will be discussed specifically. Ultimately, the United Nations Framework for Climate Change has left it to individual countries to develop their own <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/workstreams/national_adaptation_plans/items/6057.php">National Adaptation Plans</a>. Egypt’s prime minister formed a <a href="http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/07/17/egypt-to-form-national-climate-change-council/">National Committee on Climate Change</a> in July to draft an up-to-date national strategy for combatting the problem, but a copy of this strategy has not been made public (if indeed it has been fully drafted).</p>
<p>In the meantime, there has been little if any international pressure on Egypt to update its national strategy expediently. All international critiques of Egypt tend to focus on the country’s national security problems, human rights abuses and poor democratic governance. As long as climate change remains a second-tier issue for the international community, the Egyptian state—and its people—will also regard it as one.</p>
<p>Even Abu Ghali, whose mango trees could be floating in saltwater within his lifetime, believes tackling climate change should come second to tightening security and restoring the economy. He has full confidence his president will help him in due time. “The government is under a lot of pressure,” Abu Ghali says. “We can’t expect everything to come all at once. [President Abdel-Fattah ] el-Sissi needs to first give jobs to people who need them. Later, he will help us.” Inshallah.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part of the Mekong Delta – home to 20% of Vietnam’s population and 50% of its rice production &#8211; is at risk of disappearing as sea levels rise.</em></p>
<p>In fields across Vietnam’s Ca Mau Province, one of the country’s most important agricultural regions, wispy rows of rice struggle to grow in dingy yellow water.</p>
<p>“This year’s crop is totally lost,” explained Bui Van Sim, a farmer in the province’s Le Giao village. &#8220;Saltwater has appeared everywhere. There is no rain; almost 100% of the rice has died.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_108" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3034.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" class="wp-image-108 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3034.jpg" alt="A farmer looks at his rice crop in Ca Mau.

Due to unusual weather this year, with too little rain, 90% of the rice fields in Bien Bach commune of Thoi Binh district are flooded with salt and alum water. (Credit: Hoang Huong)</p></div>
<p>Ca Mau is a low-lying coastal region that sits along Vietnam’s southernmost tip, so flooding and seawater encroachment happen frequently. But with an average elevation of approximately one meter above sea level, Vietnamese officials say that global warming and subsequent sea level rise threatens to submerge an estimated 40% of the province.</p>
<p>Locals like Sim used to be accustomed to two seasons: one that allowed them to grow rice and another to farm shrimp. The rainy season, which lasted from June to November, flooded river banks and desalted the fields to create ideal conditions for producing rice. After the rice harvest, farmers would let the fields dry before pumping saltwater into them to breed shrimp. However, these traditional practices are slowly changing.</p>
<p>Tran Thi Diep, who also lives in Le Giao, said that this year has seen little rain, despite the abundant downfalls that usually take place between July and August. With no freshwater to flush the salt from the fields, the rice crop is suffering.</p>
<p>Of the 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, Ca Mau and Kien Giang are two of the most seriously affected by the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>According to official estimates, 80% of Ca Mau is at risk of submersion. The province already has nearly 10,000 hectares of its agricultural land affected by salinity. Moreover, sea dikes that slow encroaching waters and prevent erosion are seriously degraded.</p>
<p>In recent years, Kien Giang has experienced heavy flooding that has devastated the province’s people and economy by destroying property, rice fields and fish farms. Regional officials estimate that if the sea level rises about 85-105 centimeters, most of Kien Giang province will also be submerged.</p>

<p>Erosion along riverbanks, islets and coastal areas is causing great difficulties for people and local governments.<em> </em>In 2009, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved plans to fund more than VND 1 trillion (over $44 million) for 51 provinces to upgrade their dyke and embankment systems. Kien Giang province has also implemented numerous action plans since 2010 to protect the coastline, including the replanting of about 430 hectares of forests.<em><br />
</em><br />
A few months ago, Long Khanh islet in nearby Dong Thap province eroded almost completely and water invaded residential areas, endangering people’s lives. Hundreds of people still need to be relocated, pushing the government into the uneasy situation of finding funds for new land.<br />
Early in September, a surge in the river washed away a home in Cha La village. Luckily, locals say the family was away that night, so no one was hurt.</p>
<p>Boating along the Nam Can River and Ganh Hao River of Ca Mau, one can see that many houses, including those made out of concrete, have collapsed along the eroding banks.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues of rising sea levels and erosion, the ground of the Mekong Delta is also in danger of serious sinking, a risk that could lead to the “disappearance” of these important fertile fields.</p>
<p>According to the Wetlands Management Research Center at Ho Chi Minh City University, the average level of sinking measured in Can Gio District, Ho Chi Minh City is 26.3 millimeters per year (mm/year); at the estuary of the Hau River (a branch of the Mekong River) in Can Tho, it is 14.2mm/year, while in Ca Mau it is 23.4mm/year.</p>
<div id="attachment_112" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3320.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112" class="size-full wp-image-112" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3320.jpg" alt="Two men build an embankment to prevent seawater from entering Chava village.

<p>As a result, seawater has slowly seeped into the coastal region’s rivers, canals and ponds, rendering the groundwater system undrinkable. Some districts such as Bien Bach and Thoi Binh in Ca Mau province, and An Bien and An Minh in Kien Giang province also suffer from chronic water shortages.</p>
<p>Although they live their lives surrounded by water, the residents of the Mekong Delta are thirsty.</p>
<p>Mr. Nguyen Van Cuong, who lives in Thoi Binh, is lucky enough to have a rare freshwater well, but he worries that this resource will soon be exhausted. Many people who live here must abandon wells because of saltwater intrusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays, it is harder for us to pump water by hand,” Cuong said. “In the last two years, we couldn’t pump water by hand as the water was depleted. The depth of the well is also increasing.”</p>
<p>During the rainy season, people can collect rain water or share a groundwater well. In the dry season, however, water scarcity becomes a major problem and the price to transport freshwater to the Mekong’s depleted regions is expensive: VND100,000/cubic meter (approximately $4.50), a hefty sum for the many earning only VND20,000 per day.</p>
<p>“Previously, we could find freshwater after a few tens of meters of drilling,” said Cuong. “At present, finding water at more than 100 meters of drilling is still hard; if they drill at a shallower level, there is only salty water and alum.”</p>
<div id="attachment_106" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-2963.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106" class="size-full wp-image-106" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-2963.jpg" alt="Many households in Le Giao hamlet, Thoi Binh district cannot use water from drilling wells because the underground water is contaminated by salt, alum water.

<p>According to Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the Mekong Delta could see a rise in its average temperature by 1.3 to 2.8 degrees Celsius and a rise in sea level by 66 to 99 centimeters by the end of this century. Though rain has been scarce this year, the Ministry estimates that the region could see an increase in rainfall of 4-8%, which could increase the risk of severe flooding. A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report showed that a one meter rise in sea level could result in 22 million Vietnamese people left homeless and a loss of up to 10% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product.</p>
<p>In an attempt to mitigate these impacts, many studies and projects on climate change in the Mekong Delta region have been launched worldwide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Global Climate Change (IPCC), for example, has recommended measures for countries facing similar predicaments: upgrade dike systems and coastal construction, and switch to more resistant crops and livestock.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kien Giang province approved a VND390 billion (nearly $20 million) project to build a sea dike system along the coast of the city of Rach Gia. This is a part of a larger project to upgrade the dike system from the central coast province of Quang Ngai to Kien Giang under the orders of the Prime Minister. The project is expected to be completed in 2016.</p>
<p>But this progress also bears potential risks. Interference to the natural flows along the Mekong River may have unexpected consequences downstream.</p>
<p>In early September, the Lao National Assembly officially approved the Don Sahong hydropower project, which is set to be built on the Mekong River starting in late 2015, less than two kilometers from the Laos-Cambodian border. Environmentalists fear it will have a disastrous impact on the Delta’s key fishing industries.</p>
<p>When a large area with many residents is affected, many people are forced to migrate and seek assistance. This is a grave problem for land management and social security – a problem that worsens in the Mekong Delta with each passing year.</p>
