								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For all his life, 60-year-old Abdul Rehman Dar had proudly tilled the land on his three-acre farm in the highly productive Kashmir Valley. But his work came to a sudden halt when the surging Vishu River flattened two-thirds of his village and damaged hundreds of acres of prized agricultural land in September 2014.</p>
<p>Like many others who lost nearly everything in Gund village, which lies in the southern district of Kulgam, Dar’s self-confidence has taken a beating. “All my land is under layers of mud, sand and boulders deposited by that ruthless flood,” he says, barely able to hold back tears. In a sobbing voice, he says that the loss of his farmland has shattered all his dreams.</p>
<p>After years of hard work in the fields, Dar had planned to pass the farm to his son. The region is known for its agriculture and farming was a reliable source of income that his family could rely on. Now the future is less clear.</p>
<div id="attachment_451" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-451" class="size-large wp-image-451" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-1024x681.jpg" alt="Farmer Abdul Rehman Dar has found it hard to recover from the loss of his land and house. Doctors have diagnosed him with depression. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)" width="760" height="505" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-1020x678.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-451" class="wp-caption-text">Farmer Abdul Rehman Dar has found it hard to recover from the loss of his land and house. Doctors have diagnosed him with depression. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>“Losing my prized land is simply the end of my life and the beginning of hardships for my family,” Dar says. “Some years back I refused to accept a job offer for my only son in the police department with the hope that he has a lot to thrive on in the form of my three-acre farm land. But, today I strongly regret that decision.” The guilt, he says, still haunts him, but police work is a dangerous job in a place like Kashmir where squads encounter pro-freedom protesters fighting to end Indian rule on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Though it’s been over a year since the floodwaters devastated his village, Dar still lives in a make-shift single room that was hastily provided by the government to house more than 50 displaced families. Lying in his bed, he spends a lot of time worrying about his family’s prospects. “Now what can my son do? He is not capable of working as a daily laborer, but then, he has no other option,” Dar says. “He has to earn for the survival of his family – his wife and two small kids.”</p>
<p>Job opportunities in the Kashmir Valley are slim. With little industry, most vacancies are offered by the government through its police and education departments. Recent years have seen massive corruption as desperate families often pay bribes to ensure slots for their sons and daughters on employment lists.</p>
<p>Dar says he could have easily bought that officer job for his son by bribing the fixer who offered the position. Now even these jobs are becoming scarce. “Today my son would have had the support of a steady monthly salary. But, while nature snatched away the land from him, I deprived him off a job,” he says regretfully.</p>
<p>Many farmers like Dar who are in similar positions have little to fall back on. According to official figures, around 135,000 hectares of agricultural land has suffered damage due to flooding over the last year in more than 100 villages in Kashmir. In many rural areas, surging waters from the tributaries of Jhelum washed away stretches of land where paddy, maize and orchards once stood.</p>

<p>Shahbaz Lone, a farmer in Sonawari-Bandipore, lost a year’s worth of crops and much of his land to the September floods, but he has yet to receive substantial assistance from the government, save a 200kg bag of rice. It has been difficult, he says, to find work as a day laborer and he had to sell off his herd of seven cattle because he could no longer afford to feed them.</p>
<p><strong>The Psychological Impact </strong></p>
<p>As the initial shock of devastation and loss wears off, those struggling to recover from extreme weather events with little help are facing long-term psychological impacts. Dar shows symptoms of depression and anxiety, and complains of many health issues. His son, Altaf Ahmad, has taken him to various doctors, but nothing so far has worked. “Most of the times he stays quiet and sometimes he breaks down all of a sudden,” Ahmad says. It’s becoming a common problem in the community as many flood victims waiting for assistance are losing hope.</p>
<p>Ahmad says that in addition to his father, other members of his family worry about how they will be able to build a new home without any resources coming in. So far, the family says it has received no substantial help from the government.</p>
<p>“The government had assured us of financial assistance for constructing our new homes, but we have only received 75,000 rupees ($1,175 USD), which is peanuts. And we don’t even have land where we can construct our houses. It won’t be free of danger to construct them again in our previous village which was ruined by the floods,” Ahmad says.</p>
<p>According to the latest official numbers—which many locals believe are purposefully understated— the floods destroyed 67,661 homes and affected the livelihoods of 30,000 people. During a recent visit to the region, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged 2,000 crore Indian rupees (approximately $303 million USD), but this falls far short of the estimated 44,000 crore rupees ($6.02 billion USD) requested shortly after the floods to reconstruct damaged infrastructure and compensate for losses suffered by the flood-hit families.</p>

<p>With little available help from the government, affected residents are struggling to find ways to restart their lives. Helplessness gives way to frustration, as many are unable to leave the makeshift accommodation they’ve been living in since the floods hit last September. With all members of the family occupying a single room, there is no privacy and schoolchildren lack separate rooms to study in. The aftermath of the floods, they say, has impacted all parts of their lives.</p>
<p>“A youth, who was engaged to a girl in a nearby village, was forced to break his relationship as the parents of his fiancée were not sure about his prospects,” a flood victim who preferred to stay anonymous said while referring to the challenges they have been confronting.</p>
<p>Concerns over livelihood and survival are starting to take their toll on the mental health of the community. Dr. Arshad Hussain, a psychiatrist in Srinagar, says that while this is a normal reaction for people whose lives are uprooted by a sudden disaster, it’s not surprising that effects are more strongly felt in Kashmir.</p>
<p>“Kashmir is already witness to one of the worst conflicts of modern times with huge human costs and a heavy toll on mental health,” he says. “Lifetime prevalence of major depression, substance use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is at all-time high in this part of the world.” If important steps such as psychological counseling and financial support to victims are delayed or not taken, Hussain says the problem can get much worse. “The economic costs of this huge mental health burden can be enormous,” he says. “The more we delay rehabilitation, more and more of them will succumb to depression. Such a scenario has to be avoided at all costs.”</p>
<p>Psychologist Roshan Ara, who has carried out research on the mental health of disaster victims, says that continuous engagement is necessary until key issues are addressed. “Soon after the floods, many non-governmental organizations started taking care of the mental health of the victims. Some of them had made arrangements for recreational activities for children in the cold season, but such an engagement should have been continued for some more time,” Ara says.</p>
<p><strong>Deepening hardships</strong></p>
<p>Trade is the predominant source of economic activity in Srinagar City, but thousands of small businesses were destroyed by the recent flood. Rafiq Rather used to support his family by selling clothes in Batmaloo, but his business, which was heavily damaged by the floodwaters, was not insured. “After the flood, I took the cloth rolls out of the shop and cleaned them for many days with the help of my wife and kids,” he says, “But, I still couldn’t get one-third of the money I had gotten them for.”</p>
<p>It’s a major economic blow. To make ends meet, Rather now sells clothes from a cart on the street. “Life has become really hard after the floods. I wonder for how long I can carry on,” he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_457" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-457" class="size-large wp-image-457" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31-1024x681.jpg" alt="Artisan Bashir Mir of Kelam village in south Kashmir and his family in their single room accommodation.

Mir is unable to work since he lost his home and his tools to the floods. (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>Rather is not alone. According to the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation (KTMF), over 33,000 businesses suffered losses during the September 2014 floods. A majority of them were not insured against losses due to natural disasters.</p>
<p>The Jammu and Kashmir government made assurances that businesses who had suffered losses would be given financial support, but many are still waiting. “Only around 600 shopkeepers and other businessmen among 33,000 have got the financial assistance. The rest are yet to get it,” KTMF said during a recent statement.</p>
<p>Another group, the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), has questioned the manner and pace of rehabilitation process for the flood victims. “It’s ironic that only Rs 2,000 crore rupees ($303 million USD) is earmarked for rehabilitation of flood victims and out of this, only Rs 800 crore rupees ($120 million USD) are for the rehabilitation of businesses,” says KCCI’s president, Mushtaq Ahmad Wani.</p>
<p>“The government has clearly failed to meet the expectations of the flood victims in general and the small businessmen in particular. Even insurance companies have settled claims of over 2,000 crore rupees.”</p>
<p><strong>Artisans affected</strong></p>
<p>Kashmir handicrafts such as Pashima shawls, are world famous and have long been a major source of economic income, but these prized artisans were among the worst hit. Many beautiful products and studios were damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>Without tools or material, local artisan Bashir Mir cannot work. “These days, I am as good as a fish out of water,” he says. “I used to get advance money and raw material from a trader for weaving the shawls. But ever since he heard that floods had washed away my tools and my house, he never met me for work.”</p>
<p>Like many of his fellow artisans, Mir—once highly sought after for his products—is now seeking employment as an unskilled laborer. Not only does he make less, but opportunities have also gone cold with the onset of winter.</p>
<div id="attachment_463" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-463" class="size-large wp-image-463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1024x681.jpg" alt="Women wash dishes outside their make-shift shelters (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)" width="760" height="505" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-1020x678.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-463" class="wp-caption-text">Women wash dishes outside their make-shift shelters (Credit: Athar Parvaiz)</p></div>
<p>“During the past week, I could work for two days only,” he says. In north Kashmir, an NGO has set up Artisan Production and Development Centers (APDCs) to aid unemployed workers, but artisans in Mir’s area have received no such support.</p>
<p>“Apart from the loss or damage in terms of products and tools, the artisan community was confronted with extreme financial hardships because they used to get advance wages,” says Yasir Qureshi, Senior Program Manager for  the Indo-Global Social Service Society (IGSSS). “We have set up 13 such centers and are also providing material support to the artisans for weaving of carpets. Entire amount earned by selling the product goes to the artisans.”</p>
<p>A year on, thousands of farmers, traders and skilled laborers are still waiting for the government to come out with a comprehensive plan to revive their shattered economy. In the meantime, communities are attempting to move forward. Taxi driver Bilal Ahmad Koka, who lost both of his cabs to the floods, says he was lucky they were insured. “Otherwise, today I would be also one of those wanting the government to do something for me,” Koka says. One beneficiary of the recent disasters, local insurance companies claim to have seen a 500 percent increase in new policies. “Following the floods, businessmen are insuring businesses against full value and are quite willing to pay high premiums,” says Imtiyaz Ahmad, who works for an Indian insurance company in Kashmir. But tougher regulations on agricultural businesses are preventing farmers from</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With dreams of becoming Nigeria’s &#8220;Lionel Messi,&#8221; 15-year-old Sanni Usman watches the famous footballer’s every match and trains every day in his village’s football field to sharpen his skills. But it seems his dream may be in jeopardy as his playing field could soon be gone. A stretch of gully erosion that has cut off his village road to the main town of Katsina State has started to redirect towards the community football field.</p>
<p>Bindawa is one of several local governments threatened by massive gully erosion in states across the northwest region of Nigeria. What started as a small crack on the road some five years ago has finally cut off Kaita village from Katsina/Kano highway. And many say changing weather patterns are to blame.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rains come late and don&#8217;t last for long. They are heavy, causing floods and devastating the land,” said Alhaji Ibrahim Dalhatu, the head of the local government administration in Bindawa. “As the rain moves it creates its own channels that end up breaking the soil and widen them as trenches. It started gradually but now many parts of our lands are devastated and can barely be used for agricultural purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Usman knows something is wrong but can&#8217;t explain why every year the short and heavy rain that falls in his village continues to leave large holes where the water flows. &#8220;Some years ago an access road connected my village with the highway but gradually the road was cut off. I find it hard to believe that vehicles no longer pass through my village. Especially on market days in neighboring Charanchi town, where many people travel to trade. This is now a once upon a time story because look at the road it is no longer accessible,&#8221; he said pointing dejectedly at the ground. &#8220;My fear now is that this field I come to train daily, may soon go the way of our access road.”</p>
<p>Land degradation such as gully erosion threatens to displace thousands of people in Katsina State, but could have been mitigated if the Great Green Wall project was implemented by the Nigerian government. The African Union proposed this project as a measure to combat desert encroachment in the Sahel region of Africa over a decade ago in Njamena, Chad. It involves the planting of shelter belt trees that would combat desert creep and boost the quality of the soil, as well as economic activities in the affected areas. The project involves eleven countries from Senegal in West Africa to Djibouti in East Africa.</p>
<p>Usman believes the changing rain patterns are destroying the soils of Kaita. &#8220;After last year’s rainy season, we noticed the soil became lose and cracks appeared on the ground. The land towards our field started breaking slowly, then we decided to move a bit farther from the approaching trenches. If something is not done about this trench, we may no longer have a football field to train on.”</p>

<p>Katsina receives an annual rainfall of less than one meter between early April and July. Sometimes the rainy season extends further to September. During much of this time, the rainfall is irregular and heavy, running off rather than absorbing into the dry soil. The lack of drainage channels along roads is also increasing the incidence of gully erosion. When it rains, the water always create a new channel, which becomes one of many gullies that have devastated the land in parts of Katsina State.</p>
<p>In 2013, the road between Katsina and Kano was reconstructed after collapsing during a heavy downpour. A connecting bridge was also constructed to link the road, but environmental advocate Shehu Lawal believes it may collapse in a couple of years. Construction of a bridge is not the solution, he says, the focus should instead be on creating drainage channels that can funnel excess rain and help reduce gully erosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the roads are constructed without drainage. This will surely leads to the roads been eroded. Water will always look for a channel,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Who can farm around a gully?<br />
</strong><br />
Katsina is one of the states in northern Nigeria that is affected by desert encroachment and resulting gully erosion. Many people in villages across the state are losing their lands and access roads. A massive gully along the Katsina/Kano road is especially hazardous for nighttime drivers.</p>
<p>Lawal believes that the state government needs to do more to protect the environment. &#8220;During the administration of Musa Yar&#8217;Adua [the former governor of Katsina State], many trees were planted to protect the soil, but the subsequent administration didn&#8217;t take tree planting [seriously],” he said. “In the border communities with the desert, our farmers can&#8217;t use the land. Do you know that some farmers now move to other villages to farm because of desert encroachment and these gullies? Who can farm around a gully? It is a death trap.”</p>
<p>In the local government area of Charanchi, the community primary school is surrounded by large gully trenches, which head teacher Ibrahim Ladan calls “a threat.” &#8220;This school has a population of about 600 pupils. We serve the whole community and want to build more classrooms, but there is no land to build on. The gully erosion is advancing closer to our classrooms. If nothing is done we might lose parts of this school,” he said. “We have written to the state government but nothing is yet to be done…It is a death trap but we don&#8217;t have a place where we can put our students except here.”</p>
<p>It’s an especially severe blow to Katsina State—one of the poorest in the country—which already suffers from extremely low enrollment levels. Katsina State official Hussaini Dangari said the government is attempting to teach people on the need to protect the environment and prevent such side effects as the creeping gullies through advocacy and education programs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Katsina State is the highest beneficiary of the Great Green Wall project in Nigeria,” said Dangari, Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Environment. “The shelter belt is planted across ten local governments in the frontline areas impacted by desert encroachment. Between 2013 till now, 47 kilometers of shelter belts have been planted under the Great Green Wall project in Katsina State.&#8221;</p>
<p>In October 2015, 925 million naira designated for the Great Green Wall project was recovered after being fraudulently diverted from the Federal Ministry of the Environment. This came after various investigations were carried out by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission, Nigeria&#8217;s anti-corruption agency. Coupled with the fact that Nigeria elected not send a representative to the Third African Ministerial Conference on the project a year earlier, environmental experts are questioning Nigeria’s commitment to actual implementation of the Great Great Wall Initiative.</p>
<p>A visit to the border with the Niger Republic turned up few shelter belt trees. N&#8217;Goual Djoumaye village, which sits in both Nigeria and Niger shows visible signs of desert encroachment. Moahmed Abubakar, leader of the village’s Nigerian side, said no tree has been planted in the community under the Great Green Wall project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The desert starts becoming visible from mid-December. This green (sparsely grown nerdy shrubs) you are seeing now will disappear. The trees you can see now we&#8217;re planted by us. There is not one tree planted by the Great Green Wall here,” he said. “Even though we are affected by desertification, the impacts have gotten so bad that before we could harvest an average of 10 bundles of millet but now we barely harvest 2 bundles.”</p>
<p>Instead of trees, the only sign of the project is a rusted board baring a Great Green Wall logo mounted on a pole. A fenced area close by was meant to be a nursery for the new trees, but the space is deserted. According to Ministry of Environment officials, Katsina State is supposed to be the highest beneficiary of the project.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first drops of rain drew the children out of their houses. As the first rainfall to come to Wadi el Lega, a tiny desert settlement in South Sinai, in more than six months, this was cause to celebrate. Rain brought green shrubs for their camels and goats to eat; rain refilled their cisterns; rain signaled an end to the fierce summer heat.</p>
<p>The children raced and shrieked as the rain fell harder and harder. Inside their brick houses, the parents smiled and thanked God. It was only October; such a rare early rain promised a good, wet winter. About thirty minutes went by. Then quite suddenly, the shrieks outside turned to screams.</p>
<p>“Someone began yelling that three children had been swept away by the water,” recalls Hussein, a member of the Mzeina Bedouin tribe settled in South Sinai. “The water was like a sea. It carried the children away. They found two of them, but there was one little girl they couldn’t find. They later found her when the rain stopped. She had drowned.”</p>

<p>Flash flooding has always been a danger in the valleys at the base of the Sinai Mountains. The hard, dry ground can become saturated in an instant, allowing torrents of water to rush down the mountain like a waterslide, wiping away stretches of road and <a href="https://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/01/19/97770.html">razing whole villages</a>. But historically, such floods were few and far between. It’s only in the last few years that things have started to change. The Sinai has now been hit by a series of fierce, unexpected, and unprecedented floods, and its people are struggling to protect themselves from the torrents.</p>
<p>“Ten years ago, we had rain maybe once a year,” says Haj Jabali, a 65-year old resident of St. Katherine, a town in the mountains above Wadi el Lega. “These last few years, it’s been far colder and we’ve had a lot more rain. The rain for us up here, it’s a good thing … But the rain can get up to one or two meters high down in the valley, like a sea.” In a country with an annual average rainfall of <a href="http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=country_historical_climate&amp;ThisRegion=Africa&amp;ThisCCode=EGY">41.4 mm</a>, such fierce rainstorms have caught the people and their government off guard. As it is right now, Egypt simply does not have the infrastructure to cope with these increasingly frequent floods.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>About 20 minutes’ drive from St. Katherine<strong>, </strong>down in the valley called Sebaia, Haj Ibrahim has built a dirt mound wall about half a meter high around the periphery of his family’s settlement in an effort to keep the water from rushing into their houses. “Normally, the rain falls into the ravine and its OK,” Ibrahim says. “But if it comes down really strong like it has the last few years, then it overflows out of the ravine and then it can become dangerous. It can flood into people’s houses.”</p>

<p><span class="ng-scope">As residents struggle to adapt to the rainstorms, simple retaining walls like Ibrahim&#8217;s have become common sights in the wadis, or valleys, of South Sinai. Tribal elders such as Jabali see these rainstorms as flukes—an odd interruption in their seasonal routine that will soon pass. </span> And that’s entirely possible, says Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist for the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Meteorologists have been hesitant to definitively attribute short-term changes in precipitation patterns to the long-term effects of man-made climate change. <span class="ng-scope">However, a <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-scientists-find-precipitation-global-warming-link" target="_blank">2013 study</a> by scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory showed that natural variability can&#8217;t account for all the observed changes in global precipitation. It would seem, then, that global climate change is certainly a culprit behind this uptick in extreme rainstorms.</span></p>
<p>“In such storms, the air is nearly completely saturated. And in warmer climates, that saturation level increases as it gets warmer,” Wehner says. “Hence, many individual storms have been formally attributed […] to the human induced global warming.” If these storms in the Sinai are indeed products of global climate change, then the data shows they won’t be going anywhere; rather, they could become the norm.</p>
<p>For Mohamed el Raey, a professor of environmental studies at Alexandria University, there is little doubt: these storms are a direct result of global temperature rise and Egypt is fated to see more of them. “An increase in temperatures will lead to an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events,” says el Raey. “To put it as simply as I can, the histogram of temperatures is shifting, making it more likely for extreme events to occur.” To put it <a href="http://co2now.org/Know-the-Changing-Climate/Climate-Changes/ipcc-faq-changes-in-precipitation.html">even more simply</a>, as the planet warms, water on the surface of lakes and oceans evaporates more quickly. At the same time, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it is able to retain. This means that warm places such as Egypt go longer without rain, as evaporated water accumulates in the atmosphere—and then when it does finally rain, it pours.</p>

<p>el Raey wrote as much in a <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/227086576_Climatic_drivers_of_potential_hazards_in_Mediterranean_coasts._Reg_Environ_Chang">2010 paper</a> in the journal of Regional Environmental Change, where he looked at the effects of climate change in the Mediterranean basin. “Global climate model simulations indicate that there shall be a decrease in yearly average [rainfall] values but that the return period for heavy rainfall events may decrease…. This … should lead to an intensification of flooding during the rainy period.”</p>
<p>So far, el Raey has found his predictions to be ominously accurate. “These extreme weather events started to show up in December 2010, and they’ve become more and more common,” he says. Despite decades of warnings by el Raey and others in the academic community, the more immediate problems of political instability and economic malaise have taken precedence over the projected danger of climate change. As a result, Egypt now finds itself largely unprepared for this onslaught of severe storms—and the sparsely populated, economically marginalized Sinai region is the least of the state’s worries.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>In October, President Abdel Fattah el Sisi found himself facing rare and stinging criticism <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/10/25/prime-minister-heads-to-alexandria-to-assess-damages-from-flooding/">rains inundated</a> Egypt’s second city of Alexandria, <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/26/climate-change-to-increase-alexandria-flooding.html">killing six</a> and forcing schools, businesses, and government offices to shutter for days. Dramatic photos of buses floating in five feet of water were plastered all over the front pages of the national newspapers. The governor of Alexandria was forced to resign for failing to prevent the disaster. But in reality, the city’s problems began long before the recently-elected governor came to power.</p>
<p>“Entire parts of the city have been built below sea level, but people don’t realize this,” el Raey explains. “The water collects in these areas and floods the entire first floor of some buildings.”</p>
<p>Alexandria’s other main problem is that it grew far too fast for its sewage and drainage infrastructure. The city used to have two sets of underground canals: one that drained rainwater back into the sea, and one that directed sewage water toward a treatment plant. But by 1987, with the city’s sewage system overflowing, the government opted to turn the rainwater canals into extra sewage canals, .</p>
<p>This was only ever intended to be a short-term fix, but today the city still operates without a rainwater drainage system. This wasn’t a major issue when Alexandria was receiving <a href="http://www.alexandria.climatemps.com">7.4 inches</a> of rain per year. But when hit with 10 inches of rain over a two-day span, as was the case in October, the city will all but sink.</p>
<p>“The government of Alexandria was not really aware of this problem, they were not prepared,” el Raey says. “There must be proactive planning.”</p>

<p class="ng-scope">Global leaders meeting in Paris for the <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/COP21-FAQs.pdf" target="_blank">COP21</a> Climate Change Summit are expected to draft new international regulations on greenhouse gases. But even if leaders do succeed in limiting future global warming, the current precipitation trends are likely to continue, Wehner says.</p>

<p class="ng-scope">&#8220;This means we can expect to see less normal rainfall, more droughts, and more extreme events,&#8221; el Raey adds.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Densely populated industrial cities like Alexandria can probably expect some hustle from their government to mitigate the effects of these changing weather patterns. Sisi, for his part, has already allocated $130 million to revamp Alexandria&#8217;s sewage system.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">But tiny settlements such as Wadi el Lega and Sebaia, far outside Cairo&#8217;s field of vision, are easily forgotten—and easily swept away.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[While the predicted impacts of climate change and environmental degradation are dire, it is important to note that the futures of Morocco and other countries embattled by climate change are not set in stone. The actions of polluting countries at COP 21 and in the future can go a long way to alleviating these problems.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The Sahara moves northwards</strong></h2>
<p>In 2011, a storm near Agoudim, Morocco triggered a large flood that swept down the mountain towards a small, Berber village. The river overflowed its banks and caused chaos in town: all crops near the river were lost; the only road into Agoudim suffered so much damage that it was permanently closed, and many houses were completely flooded. Despite the great personal impacts from the flood, people were most distraught about the damage to the mosque, the spiritual center of the community. Four years after, the destruction wrought by the flood sticks in the collective memory of the town as a danger of environmental change.</p>
<div id="attachment_90" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC02813.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-90" class="wp-image-90 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC02813-1024x768.jpg" alt="Aftermath of 2011 floods in Agoudim (Credit: Hassein Ouzayd)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC02813-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC02813-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-90" class="wp-caption-text">Aftermath of 2011 floods in Agoudim (Credit: Hassein Ouzayd)</p></div>
<p>It may be counter intuitive, but increased flooding is a symptom of desertification and the slow creep of the Sahara Desert. When it rains in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the lack of topsoil means that water runs straight into rivers. Hassein Ouzayd, a resident of Agoudim, told me that overgrazing and the harvest of firewood caused the devastating floods, but increased flooding is also connected to global climate change, which disproportionately impacts the world’s poorest.</p>
<p>Flooding is just one way that desertification threatens the livelihoods of rural Moroccans. Agriculture, which provides <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/business/2014/08/httpalhayatcomopinionwriters4332931-.html">44% of labor opportunities</a> and <a href="http://www.maroc.ma/en/content/green-morocoo-plan">generates 19% of GDP</a> in the country, is most at risk. Access to firewood and water are also at risk.</p>
<p>Unaddressed, these issues will diminish the quality of life in rural Morocco. Even more troubling is that experts expect climate change to make these problems worse by reducing precipitation and increasing temperature. The line between old problems caused by environmental degradation and new problems caused by global climate change is blurry, but all signs point to big changes for Moroccans, especially for poor farmers. As a Peace Corps volunteer in Agoudim from 2008-2010, I came back to Morocco in 2015 to see how environmental degradation is affecting the <em>Amazigh </em>culture.</p>
<h2><strong>The <em>Amazigh</em></strong></h2>
<p>The problems currently facing Morocco have roots in the history and culture of the country. The <em>Amazigh</em> – Berbers – migrated to Northern Africa before 10,000 B.C. Although much of Morocco has adopted Arab identity, the <em>Amazigh</em> maintain a unique language and culture in parts of the country. Rural areas – especially areas around the Rif Mountains, the Middle, High, and anti-Atlas Mountains, and near the Sahara – have resisted Arabization. The <em>Amazigh</em> are a fiercely independent people that have long fought against outside rule. Much of the “Arab Spring” protests in Morocco <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14650257">centered around an <em>Amazigh</em> independence movement</a>.</p>
<p>One way that the <em>Amazigh</em> have adopted Arab culture by is embracing Islam. In the marginalized areas where the <em>Amazigh</em> live, people tend to be socially conservative. Islam plays a central role in most people’s lives. It’s no surprise that damage to the mosque in Agoudim was so traumatic.</p>
<p>Many Moroccans regard the <em>Amazigh</em> as uneducated and poor. The word “Berber” itself has a derogatory origin, meaning barbarian in Greek and Roman. Approximately 40-45% of Moroccans <a href="http://www.al-bab.com/arab/background/berber.htm">identify as <em>Amazigh</em></a> and <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/05/01/the-berber-awakening/">speak a <em>Tamazight</em> dialect</a>, but many more have <em>Amazigh</em> ancestry. As Morocco modernizes and many Moroccans leave rural areas, younger generations speak less and less <em>Tamazight</em>, learning the more cosmopolitan languages, Arabic and French.</p>
<p>Travelling in Arab cities as a foreign, <em>Tamazight</em> speaker reveals an interesting relationship between Arabs and the <em>Amazigh</em>. Vendors and tour guides are quick to talk up their <em>Amazigh</em> roots and exotify the culture for the benefit of tourists. But many urban Moroccans told me that the <em>Tamazight</em> language I learned was the language of a backward people; their disdain for the <em>Amazigh </em>was easy to hear and feel.</p>
<p><em>Amazigh</em> areas have undergone a rapid transformation in the last twenty years. Small villages like Agoudim that were nearly completely isolated have gained electricity, cellphone service, improved access to healthcare and education, and roads that connect them with the outside world.</p>
<div id="attachment_95" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04051.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95" class="wp-image-95 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04051-1024x683.jpg" alt="Town in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Duncan Gromko)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04051-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC04051-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95" class="wp-caption-text">Town in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Duncan Gromko)</p></div>
<p>Despite this development, <em>Amazigh</em> areas remain the most marginalized in Morocco, with local economies based on semi-subsistence agriculture, pastoralism, and moderate income from tourism. According to Dr. Korbinian Freier, an environmental scientist with the Research Unit Sustainability and Global Change at the University of Hamburg, 30% of people in Southern Morocco regard herding of goats and sheep as their primary source of income. Herders walk their animals dozens and dozens of miles, often staying out weeks at a time.</p>
<p>I once walked to the top of a nearby mountain ridge; at 10,000 feet, it is about 4,000 feet above Agoudim. After three hours of hard hiking, I was amazed to find three young men from my village at the top of the mountain. They take their herds to the summit in order to eat the melting snow, which is one of the few sources of water in the summer. Herding has always been hard, but now young men walk harder to find food and water for their animals.</p>
<div id="attachment_102" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P1040239.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-102" class="size-large wp-image-102" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P1040239-1024x768.jpg" alt="Goats in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Driss Ouabess) " width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P1040239-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P1040239-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-102" class="wp-caption-text">Goats in the Atlas Mountains (Credit: Driss Ouabess)</p></div>
<p>Some communities are still semi-nomadic, moving between high mountains in summer and the desert plains in winter. Dr. Ismail Ouraich, an agricultural research from Goulmima, Morocco, said that sheep and goats are more important than just the income they generate: “[People] use livestock as bank accounts. If you have leftover, you invest it in your herd. And if you need the money, you bring the goat to the butcher for money.”</p>
<h2><strong>Environmental changes hurt the people</strong></h2>
<p>On the fringes of the Sahara Desert, Moroccan agriculture has always faced challenges of poor soil quality and little precipitation. Population and economic growth have put increased pressure on a vulnerable environment. Extensive grazing, the expansion of agriculture, and deforestation have degraded soil cover, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/261474223_A_review_of_Available_Knowledge_on_land_Degradation_in_Morocco._In_ICARDA_(eds)._Morocco._OASIS_Contry_Report_2">leading to erosion and the loss of soil fertility</a>. The Rif Mountains, for instance, have one of the highest rates of erosion in the world.</p>
<p>Energy for cooking and heating primarily comes from wood harvested from nearby forests. Mountainous areas are surprisingly cold in the winter, with individual snowstorms covering the ground in more than one foot of snow. Wood stoves are the primary means of staying warm in this frigid environment. I spent one winter night in Taararte in Midelt Province, where hillsides have been completely deforested. The family I stayed with was the wealthiest in the village and was fortunate enough to be able to buy wood driven in by trucks. Most people had to shiver around fires fueled by small bushes.</p>
<p>Each day in Agoudim, a steady stream of people on donkeys and mule exit the town, in search of firewood. A local, middle-aged woman, Ziniba*, – told me that it takes her several hours to collect wood. Women and girls are primarily responsible for wood collection and this is a huge drain on their time. Ziniba said, “I have to walk farther to cut wood now than when I first came to Agoudim [nearly 20 years ago]. I get home, I’m tired, I don’t have time to milk the cow or talk to my friends before I have to cook dinner.”</p>

<p>Without ground cover, rainwater runs immediately into rivers and floodplains, creating flash floods. Destructive floods are increasingly common in Morocco; <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/morocco-flash-flood-leaves-dozens-dead-201411243953753114.html">a flash flood</a> in 2014 killed 31 people.</p>
<p>These challenges, driven by population and economic growth, are already changing life in rural Morocco. Experts predict that climate change will exacerbate these problems, fueling the northward march of the Sahara. <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/257015529_Climate_change_vulnerability_and_adaptation_in_North_Africa_with_focus_on_Morocco">According to Dr. Janpeter Schilling</a> of the University of Hamburg, precipitation could decline by as much as 20% by 2050. At the same time, temperatures are likely to rise by two to three degrees Centigrade.</p>
<p>These changing climactic conditions could lower agriculture productivity in the region by 30-40%. Small farmers will be hurt the most because they are more dependent on seasonal weather. <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/climate-change-impacts-moroccan-agriculture-and-whole-economy">As Dr. Ouraich explains</a>, “The sector is dependent on rainfall, especially small and medium farmers, specifically with cereal crops. This problem is structural in Morocco, we’re still struggling to modernize the sector in order to reduce reliance on weather effects.”</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ouraich, the resulting food price increases will have the biggest impact on poor Moroccans. Surprisingly, many farmers are actually net buyers of food, meaning that increasing prices will hurt them.</p>
<h2><strong>Possible solutions</strong></h2>
<p>Major polluting countries shoulder major responsibility for climate change and its resulting impacts on countries like Morocco. The negotiations this year in Paris at the Conference of Parties is an opportunity for these countries to commit to change course through legally binding emissions reduction. Should pollution levels continue to rise along their predicted trajectory, however, experts are considering a number ways for Morocco to adapt to these changing conditions, including increased temperatures and low water supply.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Moroccan government launched the <em>Plan Maroc Vert</em> – Green Morocco Plan – to modernize agriculture in the country by improving productivity and resource efficiency in agriculture. Pillar One of the Plan works with larger farmers to improve farming input use, while Pillar Two focuses on working with small farmers in marginal areas by helping them switch to higher value, drought-resistant crops, such as olives. According to Dr. Gabriella Izzi, the Team Leader for the World Bank’s support for agriculture in Morocco, many of the changes will improve farmers’ resilience to climate change by better managing water use and switching to more resilient crops. Additionally, the Plan’s investments are reducing soil erosion by helping farmers switch to no-till farming methods. As of 2014, Pillar Two of the Plan has reached 722,000 farmers.</p>

<p>Despite some successes, the Moroccan Government faces a challenge to reach the small farmers who will be most affected by climate change because they are not credit-worthy. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable farmers are unable to borrow from banks that channel the Plan’s investments. Additionally, the Plan only works indirectly on issues related to herding and soil degradation.</p>
<p>Community leaders in Agoudim are skeptical about such government initiatives because previous efforts never turn out as promised. When I first arrived in 2008, there was a plan to build a community center to train people on carpet-weaving techniques and computer literacy. Two years later, the building was only half finished. When I came back to Agoudim in 2015, I was excited to see that the building was completed. To this day, however, it has been locked, shuttered, and has never hosted any of the promised activities.</p>
<p>There are small-scale projects that target pastoralism. As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco from 2011-2013, Sara del Fierro worked on a project in collaboration with the Moroccan High Commission on Water and Forests, a local development association, a nearby National Park, and local government to reduce erosion, flooding, and landslides by stabilizing river banks and reforestation. Unfortunately, the project was cancelled because of differences between the various groups.</p>
<p>Sara wrote, “I think there&#8217;s a strong sense of grassroots community organization and entrepreneurialism in Morocco, which gives it a great context for projects to thrive in. Almost every village near [my site] in the High Atlas had some sort of local organization&#8230;But introducing these kind of external projects inevitably changes the dynamic.  Questions come up: Who would be the first (pilot) site? Who gets what resources? Who decides who gets these resources?” Competition for scarce resources from international organizations can sour a project and ultimately enrich the most powerful players.</p>
<p>Another Peace Corps volunteer (2008-2010), Logan Sander, worked on a project supported by the United States Agency for International Development to introduce more efficient woodstoves in an effort to reduce deforestation from firewood collection. According to Dr. Korbinian’s research, if firewood collection were eliminated, the soil conservation benefits would be high enough to offset losses from climate change in some areas. Despite two years of work, Logan was only able to convince one business to switch to an efficient woodstove. Accustomed to their traditional stoves, people were skeptical of a foreign technology pushed by an American.</p>
<p>Changing engrained behavior in rural areas represents an enormous challenge, especially in the case of publicly owned environmental resources. Dr. Ouraich says, “It’s a collective action problem, it’s the tragedy of the commons&#8230;Nobody has the incentive to do something about it. People are smart, they’re not stupid, and they see that the cost of doing something is really high.” Hassein told me that, although people recognize the source of the problem, sheepherders are unwilling to reduce the size of their herds because they have no other way to make money.</p>
<p>Driss Ouabess, a resident of Agoudim, started a small hotel and guide service in an effort to diversify his income. If people can make money from sources that don’t degrade the land, it will reduce pressure on the environment. The hotel is growing in popularity, but in an isolated place like Agoudim, Driss is unable to attract enough tourists in order to stop farming.</p>
<p>Whether or not these small-scale efforts are effective, it is important to remember the enormity of the problem and that nothing less than economic revolution is required to reduce Morocco’s susceptibility to climate change.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Will Morocco be the same?</strong></h2>
<p>Walking the dusty streets of Agoudim for the first time since 2010 was an emotional experience. The changes like the 2011 flood are just the tip of the iceberg. The <em>Amazigh</em> have been living in the Atlas Mountains for millennia. They are a resilient people who have fought back against invading armies, but I wonder how much more they can withstand, while remaining who they are and maintaining their way of life. I admired the beauty of this place and these people, but I am afraid for their future. I know that there is no time to lose when it comes to climate action.</p>
<p>The most likely climate change adaptation strategy is not one managed centrally by the Moroccan government or supported by environmental projects, but a collection of choices made by individual Moroccans to protect their livelihoods. These choices will affect <em>Amazigh</em> traditions and a way of life that has existed for millennia. Rural Moroccans are resourceful and have always dealt with harsh climatic conditions, but climate change will test their resiliency.</p>

<p>The <em>Amazigh</em> and other North Africans will look northwards, to Europe, to escape the advancing Sahara Desert. Dr. Korbinian says, “Europe is already overwhelmed by the refugees from Syria. If climate change has a large impact and people are free to choose, this refugee wave will increase.” Will Europe and other major polluting regions invest now in order to avoid this climate catastrophe? Or will they delay and pay a different price later?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Repeated floods have destroyed the houses and livelihood of the indigenous population in Assam, leaving them increasingly at risk to being exploited, including by human traffickers</strong></p>
<p>According to the World Resources Institute approximately <a href="http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/03/world%E2%80%99s-15-countries-most-people-exposed-river-floods">5 million of the 21 million people affected by floods</a> live in India. Even within India this flooding is unevenly distributed. The <a href="http://www.nrsc.gov.in/Earth_Observation_Applications_Disaster_Management_Floods.html">Indian National Remote Sensing Centre</a> of the Indian Space Research Organisation states that, “the most flood-prone areas in India are the Brahmaputra, Ganga and Meghana River basins in the Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plains in North and Northeast India, which carry 60% of the nation’s total river flow.”</p>
<p>Assam, the most populous north-eastern state experiences the brunt of this flooding. Almost 75% of the total Indian rainfall is concentrated over a short monsoon season of four months from June to September. Rivers swell enormously during this period, overflowing their banks.</p>
<p>Apart from monsoon rains, Assam is also fed by perennial rivers originating from the Himalayan ranges in in China and Bhutan and India’s Arunachal Pradesh state. Since the glacial melts coincide with the summer monsoon season, any intensification of the monsoon contributes to flood disasters downstream. Scientists from the Indian Institutes of Technology in Delhi and Guwahati have been part <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Plans-to-mitigate-disasters-floods/articleshow/21352476.cms">of government projects looking at the impact of climate change and flooding in Assam</a>. Nevertheless the floods of 2015 were particularly devastating.</p>
<div id="attachment_42" style="width: 1030px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-ii-1020x633.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42" class="size-full wp-image-42" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-ii-1020x633.jpg" alt="Children in Assam’s flooded landscape (Credit: Mubina Akhtar) " width="1020" height="633" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-ii-1020x633.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-ii-1020x633-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-42" class="wp-caption-text">Children in Assam’s flooded landscape (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)</p></div>
<p>On 15 August 2011 when the rest of India was celebrating Independence Day, people in the Dhemaji district fled the floodwaters of the Gainadi river. A helpless administration could only watch as two women and a man clung to a tree in Tokobari village in a desperate attempt to save their lives. The SOS response came in late and more than 50 people were swept away by the flash flood including one on the tree. Tunu Duarah, a flood victim living in a make-shift shelter said, “We prepare for the floods even before the advent of spring. The three winter months bring a little respite”.</p>
<p>This September the Flood Forecast Monitoring Directorate of the Central Water Commission (CWC) warned that  high to unprecedented flood were expected in the Brahmaputra basin in Dibrugarh, Dhemaji, Tinsukia and Lakhimpur districts of Assam, due to high water levels in rivers. This second bout  of <a href="http://reliefweb.int/report/india/situation-updates-floods-assam-8th-september">floods proved disastrous</a>. Humans, farm animals and wildlife were washed away, millions of people were displaced and thousands of hectares of standing crops were destroyed.</p>
<p>According to the flood report released by the Assam Disaster Management Agency on <a href="http://www.asdma.gov.in/pdf/flood_report/2015/Daily_Flood_Report_01.09.2015.pdf">1 September 2015</a>, about 144,000 hectares of land in almost 2,000 villages had been affected, with 875,000 people affected. Dhemaji District, which was most severely affected, with almost 350,000 people feeling the fury of the floods and more than 90,000 hectares of cropland flooded. Speaking to thethirdpole.net  Robinson Kaman, the Dhemaji District Agriculture Officer estimated that as much as 3,700 hectares would have sandy silt deposited on them, affecting over 50,000 farm families. Having lost their agricultural land, house, cattle, kitchen gardens, woods and bamboo groves, some families have moved from Dhemaji some kilometres away and set up new habitation on higher ground, and are trying to eke out a livelihood through weaving on their looms.</p>
<p>The village of Digheri Mishing has embraced living on water. The village lies on both sides of the Jiadhol embankment. The houses are built on raised platforms held up by bamboo poles on both sides of the embankment. It is customary for the Mishing community to live in such houses locally known as chang ghars. The Mishings are basically river people. The river is their mother and they have grown up in her lap.  Rather than leaving their traditional homes a handful of them are now fighting all odds. They have been living in a water world bereft of any basic amenities since 1983, dependent on their fishing nets for a livelihood. The embankment is the only ground that serves multiple purposes. From providing space to their pigs and a few poultry, it also serves as a burial ground at times.</p>
<p>In over 30 years no government or aid organisation has been able to reach these people and help enhance their capacity to cope with the floods or strengthen their livelihoods. No representative from any government department or political party has even ever visited them in the last 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>Forced migration</strong></p>
<p>The June 2012 flood in Assam was recorded as the worst since 2004. The Assam Disaster Management Authority put the figure of the total number of people evacuated during that time as 383,421 and the actual number of people found in government relief camps as 484,555. Oxfam India reports put the number of flood-affected in June-July, 2012 <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/emergency-response/assam-floods">at 2.4 million while the number of displaced was half a million.</a> Like the inhabitants of Digheri- Mishing village of Dhemaji who have no option but to live in water-logged conditions, many such affected families throughout the state are not recognised in official figures. Documentation of displacement is very important for policy formulation.</p>
<div id="attachment_43" style="width: 1030px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-stilt-houses.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43" class="size-full wp-image-43" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-stilt-houses.jpg" alt="Chang ghar, houses on bamboo poles, in Assam (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)" width="1020" height="630" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-stilt-houses.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-stilt-houses-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-43" class="wp-caption-text">Chang ghar, houses on bamboo poles, in Assam (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)</p></div>
<p>The floods this September affected <a href="http://floodlist.com/asia/india-assam-floods-death-toll-rises-but-flooding-recedes-in-some-districts">1.7 million people in Assam</a>. Twenty districts of the state were severely affected and as many as 226,280 flood-hit people took shelter in 294 relief camps set up by the authorities, according to the official flood bulletin of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority in early September.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge</strong></p>
<p>After the floods, displaced people end up in make-shift camps that are always inadequate to cater to the needs of such a large number of flood-affected families. This is the usual story during floods. The large number of people, including children, women and elderly who endure a nightmarish existence in the ill-equipped shelters every year, shows the lack of disaster preparedness and response in the state. Some people move on to city slums or to become encroachers on forest lands taking up illegal activities like logging. Families that try to settle on government lands face eviction again and again.</p>
<p>With the number of displaced people growing there is a drop in the percentage children going to school. The social life of people is disrupted due to their displacement. Bijon Sarma, office bearer of the Dhemaji Press Club lamented that thousands of young people from the flood-affected families of the district abandoned their studies to find a job in hotels, spas, or work as security guards in the metros of cities like Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad, Tiruvanathapuram or Bangalore.</p>
<p><strong>Child trafficking </strong></p>
<p>More tragically children and young women fall victim to the scourge of human trafficking. Assam’s perennial flood problem has made the state a source state for child trafficking. Nobel laureate and child rights crusader Kailash Satyarthi pointed out that Assam has been a major source for child trafficking owing to the state’s huge flood displaced population. These children, the Nobel laureate lamented, finally disappear in big cities as workers in small-scale garment industries or hired as domestic workers. The crime investigation branch of Assam police records list Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts among the most vulnerable districts to the growing menace of trafficking. With no adaptive mechanisms in place, the impact of climate change compounds disaster upon disaster for the people of Assam.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As winter tightens its grip over Pakistan’s Kalash valleys, home to the ancient Kalash tribe, many parts of the mountain region are still struggling to repair the damage wrought by the floods this monsoon</em></p>
<p>“You won’t recognize Bumburet Valley when we get there,” my driver informed me as we navigated through streams and attempted to cross broken roads that were washed away by the devastating floods that hit Chitral District in July and August of this year. One now needs a four-wheel drive to reach the Kalash Valleys – a harrowing 2 hour drive from Chitral town, which sits along the border with the Afghan province of Nuristan.</p>
<div id="attachment_164" style="width: 851px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164" class=" wp-image-164" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges.jpg" alt="A bridge destroyed by recent flood waters (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan) Flood waters destroyed bridges and access to the valleys (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="841" height="631" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges.jpg 960w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-floods-washed-away-all-the-bridges-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-164" class="wp-caption-text">A bridge destroyed by recent floodwaters (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>The three Kalash valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir are encircled by high mountains, a natural barrier from Nuristan whose people were converted to Islam in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by an Afghan king. The Kalasha are an ancient tribe, the last survivors of Kafiristan (of which Nuristan was once a part), and their pre-Islamic religion is focused on their environment: although they worship a creator called “Desau”, they also believe that trees, stones and streams all have souls.</p>
<p>A narrow road used to lead into Bumburet, the largest of the three valleys. Only recently re-opened, it’s now strewn with large boulders brought down by the floodwaters. Vehicles must cut through agricultural fields and crisscross the main <em>nullah</em> – or riverbed – just to get to its villages. Near the valley’s entrance, we passed a badly damaged government primary school. Here children must study in tents along the side of the road.</p>
<p>The nearby Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation Motel is also in ruins. A gushing stream that used the surround the property turned into a surging river as floodwaters came rushing down the mountains and into the Bumburet valley, destroying its wooden chalets and large garden.</p>
<p>The rest of the valley’s main town was also badly hit. Once a popular tourist destination, the big hotels all suffered major damage, as did countless shops, around two dozen houses, many orchards, fields and of course the main road itself.</p>
<div id="attachment_168" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Children-studying-outside-the-government-primary-school-that-was-damaged-by-the-floods-.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168" class="wp-image-168 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Children-studying-outside-the-government-primary-school-that-was-damaged-by-the-floods--1024x768.jpg" alt="Children studying outside the government primary school that was damaged by the floods (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Children-studying-outside-the-government-primary-school-that-was-damaged-by-the-floods--1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Children-studying-outside-the-government-primary-school-that-was-damaged-by-the-floods--300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-168" class="wp-caption-text">Children studying outside the government primary school that was damaged by the floods (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>“I would say the floods were a result of all the deforestation that has taken place in these valleys in recent years, just look at the bare mountain sides – and of course climate change was also responsible. It is almost the end of September now and it is still warm; in earlier years the summer would end in August when we would celebrate our autumn festival,” explains Akram Hussain, a Kalash man who is in charge of the Kalasha Cultural Centre built by the Greek government in 2004, which is thankfully still intact.</p>
<p>The Centre houses an impressive museum, community center and educational facilities for the Kalash people. In the museum, one can find a large collection of Kalasha antiques like old jewelry, cooking utensils, sculptures of horses, rugs and costumes. The Kalasha women still wear their traditional dress, an embroidered black frock tied at the waist by a belt or sash.</p>
<p>Strong stone walls built around the Centre by Greek volunteers ultimately saved it from the forceful impact of the floods. “The high walls withstood the floodwaters, which came rushing down from the mountains at one end of the valley and went around the building,” says Hussain. Sadly, it’s likely to be the last bit of sizeable aid the Kalasha will receive from the Greek government, which continues to pay for teachers and school supplies at the Cultural Centre, but is now facing severe economic problems at home.</p>
<p>The Greeks believe that the Kalasha are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army, which marched through the Hindu Kush Mountains centuries ago. Indeed, last year a team of geneticists led by Oxford University sampled genomes from around the world and found that the Kalash people of Pakistan have chunks of DNA from an ancient European population.</p>

<p>Today, only 4,114 Kalasha remain according to a census conducted in July 2014, but there have been many conversions to Islam as more outsiders settle into the Kalash Valleys, often building homes near the main road. Around 1,800 Kalasha live in Bumburet, but higher up along the sides of the valley.</p>
<p>“Our culture was already under threat, and now these floods have destroyed our crops and orchards. We will have to buy food from the bazaar and store it if we are to survive this winter. Luckily, there was no loss of lives in Bumburet because we got a call from the border police which jointly patrols the border with the army. They called us over our mobile phones to warn us that the flood was coming,” says Hussain. “I called people living near the Bumburet <em>nullah</em> (the mountain stream that runs through the valley floor) and told them to get out.”</p>
<p>Hussain tells us there were two major floods in Bumburet in July and a smaller one in August. “The second flood in July that lasted for two days caused the most damage. We have never seen floods like this in the Kalash valleys before. I would say that at least half of Bumburet Valley was destroyed or damaged by these floods.”</p>
<p>Despite the widespread destruction, only four of the 22 houses swept away belonged to Kalash families. “Our houses are mostly built higher up and all the people living below ran up to our homes,” explains Shaheen Gul, a young Kalash woman living in Krakal Village in Bumburet. “But our fields with corn and beans that were ready for harvest and fruit trees like walnuts and apricots are gone as they were near the <em>nullah</em>.”</p>
<p>Krakal Village is one of the oldest settlements in Bumburet, built high above the main road. While the Kalasha’s traditional wooden homes are well-built and extremely tough, Gul says it was a terrifying night for all involved. “We could hear the flood before it arrived – we were so scared by the roaring sound in the middle of the night. Then the earth started shaking as if there was an earthquake. It was raining very hard that night,” she recalls. “Later when we came down we saw all the destruction – these floods were definitely much worse than the 2010 floods.”</p>

<p>The soldiers patrolling the border with Afghanistan say that melting glaciers also played a role in the recent floods. “There are around four glaciers high up above in these mountains overlooking Bumburet,” explains Shair Shah, a member of the Chitral Levies border force. “Glacial floods came down along with the rain water, that is why there were so many large boulders and we even saw large chunks of black ice.”</p>
<p>Syed Harir Shah, a disaster risk reduction expert from Chitral, feels that torrential rainfall was the main cause of the flooding, “The shifting of the monsoon further west to Chitral is a highly unusual event,” he says. “It needs to be researched. How did it shift? Why was no proper warning given to the people of Chitral?”</p>
<p>National climate change expert Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry blames the erratic monsoon weather this year on El Niño, a periodic warming of the ocean along the equatorial Pacific that impacts weather patterns. “[El Niño] contributed to the abruptness of the monsoon this summer. Some monsoon currents penetrated into the Hindu Kush mountain range, an area which generally lies outside the monsoon belt,” says the former head of Pakistan’s Meteorological Department. “The persistent rainfall accelerated snow melting and triggered both floods and the outbursts of glacial lakes.”</p>
<p>His explanation reflects what eyewitnesses in Rumbur Valley – the second area to be badly affected by the flooding – have reported. The third Kalash valley of Birir was not damaged by the floodwaters.</p>
<p>“The floods started on the 13<sup>th</sup> of July and we had almost continuous flooding until the 5<sup>th</sup> of August. We had rainfall almost every day. There were two types of floods – one was a glacier flood in the Rumbur <em>Nullah</em> and the other was flash floods coming down one of the mountain sides,” says Mohammed Iqbal, a Kalash social worker with the Pakistan Red Crescent Society. “The water flooded into the Jestak temple (dedicated to the deity that protects family) in Balanguru village, but luckily it was not badly damaged.”</p>
<p>According to Iqbal, a survey of the valley found that around 34 houses in Rumbur were damaged or destroyed by the floods, but an early mobile alert from shepherds high up in the mountains prevented any loss of life in the valley. “The shepherds told us that they saw cloudbursts over the Gangalurat glacier on the boundary with Nuristan which then burst,” he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_159" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" class="size-full wp-image-159" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg" alt="Damaged homes near the river (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river.jpg 960w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-damaged-homes-near-the-river-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-159" class="wp-caption-text">Damaged homes near the river (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>The floods brought down boulders, trees and whatever else was in their way, destroying orchards, fields, water channels and roads. Today the road to Rumbur Valley – an hour’s drive from the larger Bumburet Valley – is barely open. At a certain point, one must travel by foot to the villages beyond a bridge that has miraculously survived.</p>
<p>“I think there were around 40 to 50 floods here this summer – in 2010 (a year of widespread flooding throughout Pakistan) there was just one big flood,” explains Iqbal as we walk a path to the valley that eventually disappears, having been swept away by the flood in the <em>nullah</em>.</p>
<p>The Kalash people living higher up in the Rumbur Valley have to literally cling to the cliff wall above the <em>nullah. </em>Precarious wooden planks wedged into the mountainside provide a rickety path to the main village where shops are located. There are no big hotels here, just a few guesthouses where tourists can stay overnight. Locals say the re-opening of the road to the valley in late September brought an end to a worsening food crisis, at least for now.</p>
<p>“We were confined to the houses located further up on the mountain sides and we ran out of food,” recalls Iqbal. “We had to rely on the army helicopters who dropped wheat and other rations during the floods.” Luckily, their mobile phones were still working so they could alert the outside world.</p>
<div id="attachment_166" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166" class="size-large wp-image-166" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach-1024x768.jpg" alt="Traditional Kalash homes are built high up on the sides of the mountain (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-traditional-Kalash-homes-are-built-high-up-on-the-mountain-sides-from-floods-cannot-reach-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-166" class="wp-caption-text">Traditional Kalash homes are built high up on the sides of the mountain (Credit: Rina Saeed Khan)</p></div>
<p>“The noise of the floods was deafening. The children are still so traumatized. Every time it rains now they start crying and saying ‘a flood is coming,’” says Naseem, a Kalash woman who lives in Grum Village at the entrance to the Rumbur Valley. She says with winter approaching they will be facing some hard times.</p>
<p>“All our crops with potatoes, beans and sorghum near the <em>nullah</em> are gone along with so many fruit trees,” she says. “The drinking water supply has not been restored and the women have to go down to the <em>nullah</em> daily to fetch water and carry it up in large vessels. The children and elderly are starting to get waterborne diseases and falling sick. The electricity has not been restored either.” A micro-hydro plant used to provide electricity to Rumbur Valley, but was damaged by the floods. The community plans to fix it before winter. The main water pipeline was also damaged and the local people are urging the government to restore it.</p>
<p>“For now the people who lost their homes are living with relatives, but that will put a strain on everyone over the long winter months when the valley is cut off by snow and we can’t buy supplies from the outside. In November, the snow starts to fall and roads are closed for almost four months,” says Quaid-e-Azam, a Kalash man who works for a hotel in Chitral town. “However, I have heard that the World Food Programme is planning to give food to the Kalash Valleys for the four winter months.”</p>
<p>Despite the obvious hardships, the Kalasha people remain quite resilient. They even celebrated their annual Uchaw Festival in late August. “Uchaw commemorates the harvest,” explains Azam, “and we celebrated it…despite all the destruction. This is a religious festival and we have to continue with our culture and rituals.”</p>
<p>But he worries about the future. “The floods are becoming worse each year…we have to plan now for future floods. Today because of the growing population in the Kalash valleys people have no choice but to build near the <em>nullah,</em> but they are risking their lives. They only got saved this time because of the mobile phone warning. They were extremely lucky.”</p>

<p>Some Kalash villagers fear their deities are angry with them for the widespread environmental damage that has taken place in their ancestral homeland. “We feel the floods are coming as they are cursing us people for all this deforestation and destruction of their habitat,” says Zarin Khan, a Kalash man who works for the government’s Tourism Corporation in Chitral town. “Trees and entire forests have been cut down for both construction and firewood purposes, the animals living up in the mountains have no pine nuts to eat and even the birds go hungry.”</p>
<p>During the Uchaw festival, Kalash elders prayed to the creator Desau to save the people from future floods. But according to Azam, the torrential rainfall was so severe that the flooding even affected parts of Chitral where little deforestation is taking place. &#8220;The floods occurred in places like Reshun and Brepp were there are historically no forests. No one is safe now with all this climate change,” he says from behind the reception desk at the hotel he works at in Chitral town. &#8220;I&#8217;m very worried, the next few years are going to be very hard for us. We can only hope to survive with better planning.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part of the Mekong Delta – home to 20% of Vietnam’s population and 50% of its rice production &#8211; is at risk of disappearing as sea levels rise.</em></p>
<p>In fields across Vietnam’s Ca Mau Province, one of the country’s most important agricultural regions, wispy rows of rice struggle to grow in dingy yellow water.</p>
<p>“This year’s crop is totally lost,” explained Bui Van Sim, a farmer in the province’s Le Giao village. &#8220;Saltwater has appeared everywhere. There is no rain; almost 100% of the rice has died.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_108" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3034.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" class="wp-image-108 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3034.jpg" alt="A farmer looks at his rice crop in Ca Mau.

Due to unusual weather this year, with too little rain, 90% of the rice fields in Bien Bach commune of Thoi Binh district are flooded with salt and alum water. (Credit: Hoang Huong)</p></div>
<p>Ca Mau is a low-lying coastal region that sits along Vietnam’s southernmost tip, so flooding and seawater encroachment happen frequently. But with an average elevation of approximately one meter above sea level, Vietnamese officials say that global warming and subsequent sea level rise threatens to submerge an estimated 40% of the province.</p>
<p>Locals like Sim used to be accustomed to two seasons: one that allowed them to grow rice and another to farm shrimp. The rainy season, which lasted from June to November, flooded river banks and desalted the fields to create ideal conditions for producing rice. After the rice harvest, farmers would let the fields dry before pumping saltwater into them to breed shrimp. However, these traditional practices are slowly changing.</p>
<p>Tran Thi Diep, who also lives in Le Giao, said that this year has seen little rain, despite the abundant downfalls that usually take place between July and August. With no freshwater to flush the salt from the fields, the rice crop is suffering.</p>
<p>Of the 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, Ca Mau and Kien Giang are two of the most seriously affected by the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>According to official estimates, 80% of Ca Mau is at risk of submersion. The province already has nearly 10,000 hectares of its agricultural land affected by salinity. Moreover, sea dikes that slow encroaching waters and prevent erosion are seriously degraded.</p>
<p>In recent years, Kien Giang has experienced heavy flooding that has devastated the province’s people and economy by destroying property, rice fields and fish farms. Regional officials estimate that if the sea level rises about 85-105 centimeters, most of Kien Giang province will also be submerged.</p>

<p>Erosion along riverbanks, islets and coastal areas is causing great difficulties for people and local governments.<em> </em>In 2009, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved plans to fund more than VND 1 trillion (over $44 million) for 51 provinces to upgrade their dyke and embankment systems. Kien Giang province has also implemented numerous action plans since 2010 to protect the coastline, including the replanting of about 430 hectares of forests.<em><br />
</em><br />
A few months ago, Long Khanh islet in nearby Dong Thap province eroded almost completely and water invaded residential areas, endangering people’s lives. Hundreds of people still need to be relocated, pushing the government into the uneasy situation of finding funds for new land.<br />
Early in September, a surge in the river washed away a home in Cha La village. Luckily, locals say the family was away that night, so no one was hurt.</p>
<p>Boating along the Nam Can River and Ganh Hao River of Ca Mau, one can see that many houses, including those made out of concrete, have collapsed along the eroding banks.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues of rising sea levels and erosion, the ground of the Mekong Delta is also in danger of serious sinking, a risk that could lead to the “disappearance” of these important fertile fields.</p>
<p>According to the Wetlands Management Research Center at Ho Chi Minh City University, the average level of sinking measured in Can Gio District, Ho Chi Minh City is 26.3 millimeters per year (mm/year); at the estuary of the Hau River (a branch of the Mekong River) in Can Tho, it is 14.2mm/year, while in Ca Mau it is 23.4mm/year.</p>
<div id="attachment_112" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3320.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112" class="size-full wp-image-112" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3320.jpg" alt="Two men build an embankment to prevent seawater from entering Chava village.

<p>As a result, seawater has slowly seeped into the coastal region’s rivers, canals and ponds, rendering the groundwater system undrinkable. Some districts such as Bien Bach and Thoi Binh in Ca Mau province, and An Bien and An Minh in Kien Giang province also suffer from chronic water shortages.</p>
<p>Although they live their lives surrounded by water, the residents of the Mekong Delta are thirsty.</p>
<p>Mr. Nguyen Van Cuong, who lives in Thoi Binh, is lucky enough to have a rare freshwater well, but he worries that this resource will soon be exhausted. Many people who live here must abandon wells because of saltwater intrusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays, it is harder for us to pump water by hand,” Cuong said. “In the last two years, we couldn’t pump water by hand as the water was depleted. The depth of the well is also increasing.”</p>
<p>During the rainy season, people can collect rain water or share a groundwater well. In the dry season, however, water scarcity becomes a major problem and the price to transport freshwater to the Mekong’s depleted regions is expensive: VND100,000/cubic meter (approximately $4.50), a hefty sum for the many earning only VND20,000 per day.</p>
<p>“Previously, we could find freshwater after a few tens of meters of drilling,” said Cuong. “At present, finding water at more than 100 meters of drilling is still hard; if they drill at a shallower level, there is only salty water and alum.”</p>

<p>According to Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the Mekong Delta could see a rise in its average temperature by 1.3 to 2.8 degrees Celsius and a rise in sea level by 66 to 99 centimeters by the end of this century. Though rain has been scarce this year, the Ministry estimates that the region could see an increase in rainfall of 4-8%, which could increase the risk of severe flooding. A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report showed that a one meter rise in sea level could result in 22 million Vietnamese people left homeless and a loss of up to 10% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product.</p>
<p>In an attempt to mitigate these impacts, many studies and projects on climate change in the Mekong Delta region have been launched worldwide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Global Climate Change (IPCC), for example, has recommended measures for countries facing similar predicaments: upgrade dike systems and coastal construction, and switch to more resistant crops and livestock.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kien Giang province approved a VND390 billion (nearly $20 million) project to build a sea dike system along the coast of the city of Rach Gia. This is a part of a larger project to upgrade the dike system from the central coast province of Quang Ngai to Kien Giang under the orders of the Prime Minister. The project is expected to be completed in 2016.</p>
<p>But this progress also bears potential risks. Interference to the natural flows along the Mekong River may have unexpected consequences downstream.</p>
