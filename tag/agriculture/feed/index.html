								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northern Nigeria is a region of vast arable land, capable of feeding the entire country with enough left to export. Yet millions of its inhabitants have been uprooted in their own country, victims of the advancing Sahara Desert that is moving southward at a rate of 0.6 kilometers per year.</p>
<p>The resulting land deterioration leaves formerly productive fields barren and unfit for human habitation, which threatens not only food security but economic and social stability. Nigeria is one of the nations most at risk with 11 northern states at the front lines, including Kebbi, Zamfara, Gombe, Yobe, Adamawa and Bauchi.</p>
<p>Reports say that Nigeria loses at least 35,000 hectares of its arable land annually to desert encroachment in the north. This is comparable to the size of Lagos State, Nigeria&#8217;s economic capital and its most populous region. According to Alhaji Garba Sale, the Director of Forestry and Ecology in Kano State, one major consequence of northern desert encroachment is the massive migration of the people due to the loss of farmlands, a situation that puts pressure on food production in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major socio-economic impact of desert encroachment is the loss of farmlands. Immediately following that is migration syndrome because once the local population loses their farmlands, the alternative option for them is to relocate and unfortunately they relocate to urban areas,” said Sale. “By moving to the cities, we are creating more mouths to be fed while farm produce is reduced. This is a big problem. No nation can survive if this is allowed to go on.”</p>

<p>A tour of some of the affected states, including Katsina, Kano, and Sokoto, reveals that rainfall—still heavy in some southern states—has been dramatically reduced, many streams have dried up and crops have withered on the vine. According to a 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), &#8220;agricultural production and food security (including access to food) in many African countries and regions are likely to be severely compromised by climate change and climate variability.”</p>
<p>A number of countries in Africa already face semi-arid conditions that make agriculture challenging and climate change will likely to reduce the length of growing season as well as eliminate large regions of formerly productive agricultural land. Projected yield reductions in some countries “could be as much as 50% by 2020, and crop net revenues could fall by as much as 90% by 2100, with small-scale farmers being the most affected.”</p>
<p>Along the border with the Niger Republic, farmers complain that crop yields have reduced by as much as 80%. Farm lands which used to produce over ten bundles of millet now can barely produce two due to ravaging deserts that are leaving a trail of poverty in their path.</p>
<p>Sambo Issah, a local leader in the farming community said that further intervention is needed from the government. Research into quick maturing crop species, for example, is critical since the rainy season has drastically shortened to about three months per year. Issah said the government has promised to create a four kilometer long shelter belt, or line or trees, to protect crop lands from harsh weather and encroaching desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are suffering here in Köngo Village, in Mai Adua Local government. Here we face many environmental problems such as erosion and desert encroachment. This has caused reduction in farm produce while some areas cannot be cultivated at all,” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rainfall keeps reducing each year. Some 10 years ago, we used to witness rainfall for at least 5-6 months and the farm harvest was impressive,” Issah said. “Now we hardly get three months of rainfall.”</p>
<h2><strong>Advancing desert fueling conflict</strong></h2>
<p>Conflict over dwindling land resources has also fueled violence between farmers and nomadic herdsmen, reportedly claiming hundreds of lives over the last five years and mounting economic losses. The group known as the Fulani herdsmen has been accused of raping women, destroying farmlands and inducing inter-ethnic violence as they move from state to state in search of viable grazing land for their flock.</p>
<p>But experts say that herders have long been neglected by federal development programs that favor agrarian farmers. “There is a National Policy on Livestock Agriculture, but that is hardly implemented,” said Mallam Ahmed Bello, a top official with the Confederation of Traditional Herder Organizations in West Africa. Traditional grazing routes, he says, have been overtaken by farmers who use the land for cultivation or information irrigation areas during the dry season. “The herdsmen are aware of the grazing corridors and they know their routes,” he said, “but when these routes are encroached on, we have conflicts.”</p>
<p>Statistics from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture show that more than half of Nigeria’s national grazing routes have been encroached upon. Actions that have sparked “a call to war,” according to Saidu Bala, a herder from Plateau state. “What do you expect from us when our source of existence is threatened?” he asked. “We have no option but to fight back.”</p>
<p>The Islamist insurgency in parts of northern Nigeria has also been linked to the advancing desert. Locals say that Boko Haram militants hide behind the instability caused by poverty and unemployment, and use hopelessness as a recruitment tool.</p>
<h2><strong>A way forward?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Experts say the time is now for the Nigerian government to execute its commitments under the Great Green Wall (GGW) project, a regional initiative to create a wall of trees and block the desert from encroaching southwards.</p>
<p>The wall of trees is expected to run across frontline areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in West Africa, through 11 states in Nigeria to Djibouti in East Africa. Ten years after the GGW project was conceived, it has yet to fully commence in Nigeria. In Katsina State, an area designated for project implementation is waiting to break ground. Trees are still in the nursery, while a solar borehole for watering the plants sits nearby.</p>
<p>But Hussaini Dangari, the Permanent Secretary for Katsina States’s Ministry of the Environment, insists that the project has fully kicked off and was positively affecting host communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katsina state has the greatest number of local governments that the GGW Program covers. The state also is contributing a lot towards the success of this project through not only funding, but also in sensitizing the public to know the importance of it,” Dangari said. “Orchards are also being established so that the communities can use them. The seedlings are raised by the communities themselves.”</p>
<p>In addition to the GGW project, many northern states have their own individual tree planting initiatives, some spanning as long as thirty years, others much newer, but the positive impact they have on farm land is clearly visible. In areas where trees have grown big enough to block the wind, crop yields were high unlike other unprotected areas, as observed in Kongo and Kano state.</p>
<p>Bold steps taken by the Nigerian government to mitigate the impact of northern desert encroachment through the GGW project, in addition to other structured tree planting initiatives and adaptation measures, is a critical step to securing a successful future for the people.</p>

<p><em>Climate change is affecting people across the planet, however, it disproportionately impacts women, particularly those living in poor countries who are traditionally tasked with gathering food, water and fuel for the family. </em></p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>As climate change dries up streams and lakes, women are walking longer distances to fetch water, firewood and other domestic necessities that are vital for every day life. Farming, an activity often carried out by women in African societies, has also been affected.</p>
<p>Under searing temperatures and reduced rainfall, crops are smaller and sometimes do not grow at all. In many of these traditionally patriarchal societies, women have little influence over social and political issues. This is especially the case in northern Malawi, where women are often constrained by laws and cultural norms that limit their economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Though communities here depend on this agricultural production for both income and food, women&#8217;s access to land and ownership of land is heavily restricted. In the northern region districts of Karonga and Mzimba, for example, women are generally not allowed to own enough land for large-scale agricultural production that could promote their economic independence. Instead productive land is primarily controlled by male family members.</p>
<p>But as crops continue to struggle under the effects of climate, many women farmers have begun to lead in the practice of something known as conservation agriculture. This technology enables growers to yield much more from small pockets of land, despite warmer temperatures and erratic rains. It is, however, labor intensive and requires long hours that are often difficult to meet under the pressures of other gender-related roles.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6DEk8aw07ng" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“I always wake up early in the morning searching for food for my children and I don’t find time to concentrate in the garden let alone to take part in the new ways of farming. I am aware of conservation agriculture and I know women who take part, but it’s difficult and so involving I can’t do it alone,&#8221; said Jenipher Tchongwe, who is a mother of four. She added that if she had a husband to take care of some of the family’s needs, she would have taken part in conservation agriculture.</p>
<p>Some women have started growing crops that don’t need much water, such as hybrid maize instead of local varieties They are also using manure, soil and water management, pit growing, soil cover and minimum tillage among other methods.Despite being a widow with seven children, Jessica Kaluwa, is a farmer who is leading in the practice of conservation agriculture. She began to experiment with these methods in 2012 to see if they would work.</p>
<p>“I saw others around my area doing it. I then told myself to give it a try and it really worked for me,” Kaluwa said. She added that since conservation agriculture requires so much time, one must commit. “As a woman, it’s a challenge to concentrate since there are so many other duties I have to fulfill since I have no husband to take up other challenges,&#8221; she added. But she was quick to point out that women could make more of an impact in the agricultural sector if only they had the same land ownership rights as men.</p>
<p>Winnie Ngulube is a mother of four, who is taking part in irrigation farming. She manages to harvest twice a year and she gets all her financial needs from the activity.</p>
<p>“Irrigation farming is another way of farming which Malawians need to focus on. I have managed to raise my kids alone through this way of farming. I harvest twice a year crops like maize, sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes and I mostly sell the produce,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One advocate for women&#8217;s land rights is Chief Kyungu, a prominent leader in Karonga who is working hard to change views on land ownership. Kyungu mandated that under his jurisdiction, women could inherit their husbands’ lands.</p>
<p>“Land distribution culturally favors men since it is believed that they are bread winners. People forget that women are more responsible when it comes to family matters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are taking advantage of the current gender sensitization to change people’s mindsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security has been working on leveling the playing field for both men and women by taking legal action against those who refuse to pass land to women land through the introduction of property grabbing laws. These laws are designed to protect women, but are often subverted due to fear and intimidation in rural regions.</p>
<p>The Malawian government has also introduced so-called &#8220;50:50 campaigns&#8221; where all farmers, male or female, are given the same opportunity in taking farming roles and sponsorship. Gordon Yiwombe from the Ministry of Agriculture emphasized that things are now changing in order to help women farmers overcome long-held restrictions to land ownership.</p>
<p>“In my experience in the field of agriculture and gender,&#8221; said Yiwombe, who works as the principal gender roles and extension support services officer for the ministry, &#8220;I have observed that women farmers produce more than men if they are given the same support despite facing challenges connected to gender roles.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">Evidence on the ground shows that women are feeding Malawi despite the challenges of traditional societal roles and gender-based restrictions. Despite this progress, women remain vulnerable to rigid societal roles, which limits their ability to practice climate-resilient agriculture. Without these important changes, it will become more difficult for them to produce enough food to feed their families.</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">If Malawi wants to seek solutions to changing climatic conditions, it should empower its women to lead the way.</div>
