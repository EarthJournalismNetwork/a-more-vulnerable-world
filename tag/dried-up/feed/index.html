								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northern Nigeria is a region of vast arable land, capable of feeding the entire country with enough left to export. Yet millions of its inhabitants have been uprooted in their own country, victims of the advancing Sahara Desert that is moving southward at a rate of 0.6 kilometers per year.</p>
<p>The resulting land deterioration leaves formerly productive fields barren and unfit for human habitation, which threatens not only food security but economic and social stability. Nigeria is one of the nations most at risk with 11 northern states at the front lines, including Kebbi, Zamfara, Gombe, Yobe, Adamawa and Bauchi.</p>
<p>Reports say that Nigeria loses at least 35,000 hectares of its arable land annually to desert encroachment in the north. This is comparable to the size of Lagos State, Nigeria&#8217;s economic capital and its most populous region. According to Alhaji Garba Sale, the Director of Forestry and Ecology in Kano State, one major consequence of northern desert encroachment is the massive migration of the people due to the loss of farmlands, a situation that puts pressure on food production in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major socio-economic impact of desert encroachment is the loss of farmlands. Immediately following that is migration syndrome because once the local population loses their farmlands, the alternative option for them is to relocate and unfortunately they relocate to urban areas,” said Sale. “By moving to the cities, we are creating more mouths to be fed while farm produce is reduced. This is a big problem. No nation can survive if this is allowed to go on.”</p>

<p>A tour of some of the affected states, including Katsina, Kano, and Sokoto, reveals that rainfall—still heavy in some southern states—has been dramatically reduced, many streams have dried up and crops have withered on the vine. According to a 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), &#8220;agricultural production and food security (including access to food) in many African countries and regions are likely to be severely compromised by climate change and climate variability.”</p>
<p>A number of countries in Africa already face semi-arid conditions that make agriculture challenging and climate change will likely to reduce the length of growing season as well as eliminate large regions of formerly productive agricultural land. Projected yield reductions in some countries “could be as much as 50% by 2020, and crop net revenues could fall by as much as 90% by 2100, with small-scale farmers being the most affected.”</p>
<p>Along the border with the Niger Republic, farmers complain that crop yields have reduced by as much as 80%. Farm lands which used to produce over ten bundles of millet now can barely produce two due to ravaging deserts that are leaving a trail of poverty in their path.</p>
<p>Sambo Issah, a local leader in the farming community said that further intervention is needed from the government. Research into quick maturing crop species, for example, is critical since the rainy season has drastically shortened to about three months per year. Issah said the government has promised to create a four kilometer long shelter belt, or line or trees, to protect crop lands from harsh weather and encroaching desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are suffering here in Köngo Village, in Mai Adua Local government. Here we face many environmental problems such as erosion and desert encroachment. This has caused reduction in farm produce while some areas cannot be cultivated at all,” he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rainfall keeps reducing each year. Some 10 years ago, we used to witness rainfall for at least 5-6 months and the farm harvest was impressive,” Issah said. “Now we hardly get three months of rainfall.”</p>
<h2><strong>Advancing desert fueling conflict</strong></h2>
<p>Conflict over dwindling land resources has also fueled violence between farmers and nomadic herdsmen, reportedly claiming hundreds of lives over the last five years and mounting economic losses. The group known as the Fulani herdsmen has been accused of raping women, destroying farmlands and inducing inter-ethnic violence as they move from state to state in search of viable grazing land for their flock.</p>
<p>But experts say that herders have long been neglected by federal development programs that favor agrarian farmers. “There is a National Policy on Livestock Agriculture, but that is hardly implemented,” said Mallam Ahmed Bello, a top official with the Confederation of Traditional Herder Organizations in West Africa. Traditional grazing routes, he says, have been overtaken by farmers who use the land for cultivation or information irrigation areas during the dry season. “The herdsmen are aware of the grazing corridors and they know their routes,” he said, “but when these routes are encroached on, we have conflicts.”</p>
<p>Statistics from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture show that more than half of Nigeria’s national grazing routes have been encroached upon. Actions that have sparked “a call to war,” according to Saidu Bala, a herder from Plateau state. “What do you expect from us when our source of existence is threatened?” he asked. “We have no option but to fight back.”</p>
<p>The Islamist insurgency in parts of northern Nigeria has also been linked to the advancing desert. Locals say that Boko Haram militants hide behind the instability caused by poverty and unemployment, and use hopelessness as a recruitment tool.</p>
<h2><strong>A way forward?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Experts say the time is now for the Nigerian government to execute its commitments under the Great Green Wall (GGW) project, a regional initiative to create a wall of trees and block the desert from encroaching southwards.</p>
<p>The wall of trees is expected to run across frontline areas in Sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal in West Africa, through 11 states in Nigeria to Djibouti in East Africa. Ten years after the GGW project was conceived, it has yet to fully commence in Nigeria. In Katsina State, an area designated for project implementation is waiting to break ground. Trees are still in the nursery, while a solar borehole for watering the plants sits nearby.</p>
<p>But Hussaini Dangari, the Permanent Secretary for Katsina States’s Ministry of the Environment, insists that the project has fully kicked off and was positively affecting host communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katsina state has the greatest number of local governments that the GGW Program covers. The state also is contributing a lot towards the success of this project through not only funding, but also in sensitizing the public to know the importance of it,” Dangari said. “Orchards are also being established so that the communities can use them. The seedlings are raised by the communities themselves.”</p>
<p>In addition to the GGW project, many northern states have their own individual tree planting initiatives, some spanning as long as thirty years, others much newer, but the positive impact they have on farm land is clearly visible. In areas where trees have grown big enough to block the wind, crop yields were high unlike other unprotected areas, as observed in Kongo and Kano state.</p>
<p>Bold steps taken by the Nigerian government to mitigate the impact of northern desert encroachment through the GGW project, in addition to other structured tree planting initiatives and adaptation measures, is a critical step to securing a successful future for the people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the roof of their home was brought crashing down in a planned demolition, Ma Guoqing and his family set off to start their new life. Ma, 31, was leaving the village of Luziwo in the northern Chinese province of Ningxia, where he lived with his parents, his wife and his son.</p>
<p>They knew nothing of their new home, as he’d been given only a new key and the address. So on a cold and clear December day in 2013, only two days after definite notice of relocation was issued, they set off in a large convoy of trucks hired by the government to move the villagers. They left the mountains in the south of Ningxia and headed for the plains of the north, leaving behind a village of broken old homes.</p>
<p>Ma and his family’s move was just one small part of plans by Ningxia officials to relocate 350,000 people. Residents are being forced to abandon their homes in an area that is becoming increasingly sandy, where the environment is fragile, rain is rare, and natural disasters frequent.</p>
<div id="attachment_436" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-436" class="size-full wp-image-436" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1.jpg" alt="This Chinese language graphic from thepaper.cn charts the movements of villagers from arid areas of southern Ningxia to northern parts of the province " width="630" height="804" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1.jpg 630w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1-235x300.jpg 235w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ningxia_migrant_meitu_1-627x800.jpg 627w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-436" class="wp-caption-text">This Chinese language graphic from thepaper.cn charts the movements of villagers from arid areas of southern Ningxia to northern parts of the province</p></div>
<p>The parched loess plateau is also one of China’s poorest regions. Better known as Xihaigu, in 1972 it was named by the UN World Food Programme as one of the world’s most uninhabitable places.</p>
<p>Today, Xihaigu is the site of an ecological restoration scheme in which entire villages are to be emptied. When residents leave, their homes are demolished, even with neighbouring homes still occupied. Deputy head of the Ningxia Relocation Bureau, Guo Jianfan, says this new policy aims for more decisive relocations than in the past.</p>
<p>Authorities justify the harsh moves, saying people relocated to other areas often drift back, dividing their time between old and new homes, making it difficult to manage movements of population and restore vulnerable ecology such as grasslands.</p>
<p>Luziwo village is named after the reeds that grow in a hollow up in a mountain gully, where the soil is so salty crystals lie on the ground like snow. Located in Xiji county, part of Guyuan city in southern Ningxia, droughts there can last years, and new arrivals find their throats dry up and crack, just like the soil.</p>
<p>So how dry is it? Figures from the county meteorological bureau put the average annual rainfall at between 200 and 650 millimetres – but that is far outstripped by annual evaporation figures, of between 1,500 and 2,000 millimetres.</p>
<p>Access to water is the focus of village life. The first daily chore is to direct donkeys to the well and haul back water that is then stored in underground cisterns.</p>
<p>While younger villagers are keen to leave and escape poverty, and outsiders are unlikely to choose to live here, the area is still overpopulated.</p>
<p>Ma Zhongyu, former deputy head of the Ningxia Development and Reform Commission, says the south of the province can only support about 1.3 million people – compared with the 2.3 million living there currently. Overpopulation, he says, exacerbates poverty and environmental damage.</p>
<p>A relocation programme was launched in 2011 in order to reduce pressure on the environment as part of the 12th Five-Year Plan. Luziwo was chosen as one of the villages from which residents were relocated, moving to a village 500 kilometres north in Pingluo county, located near Miaomiao lake.</p>
<p>Although relocations only began in the past few years, Ningxia’s arid climate is by no means a recent phenomenon, said Wang Yiming, a professor at Ningxia University’s School of Resources and the Environment.</p>
<p>“The arid environment of the north-west of China started to take shape around 65 million years ago,” explained Wang. “The formation of the Himalayas greatly increased the height of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and aridity increased.”</p>
<p>But climate change does seem to be making things worse.</p>
<p>Research by the Ningxia Meteorological Bureau has found average temperatures here have increased by 2.2C over the last 50 years, with droughts and other extreme weather events becoming more frequent.</p>
<p>That compares with an average global increase in land surface temperatures by 0.85C over the last 130 years, according to the UN&#8217;s climate science panel.</p>
<p>In some areas, increased temperatures can lead to more rainfall, but Ningxia’s arid conditions and impact of global warming will result in increased evaporation, so any extra precipitation will be lost, says climate expert Lin Erda.</p>
<p>A joint study into climate change adaptation in China, carried out in 2010 by China, the UK and Switzerland, found that agriculture in central and southern Ningxia relies on precipitation, rather than irrigation.</p>
<p>Climate change has seen grain yields per mu (a Chinese unit of land measurement) fall to only about 30 kilogrammes, while climate disasters are increasing crop losses.</p>
<p>Statistics for 2005 from the Ministry of Environmental Protection show 95% of China’s poor live in areas with extremely fragile environments – areas particularly sensitive to climate change.</p>
<p>He remembers that during the time of people’s communes, any land that could be cultivated was exploited, and even mountaintops were used to try to grow crops and increase harvests.</p>
<p>“The springs didn’t give much water to start with, and after a few years the ones high up failed and new ones had to be dug lower down.”</p>
<p>The Hulu river that once rose in the southern foothills of Ningxia’s Yueliang mountains is now just a dried-up riverbed.</p>
<p>Manager of Xiji county’s water company, Gao Yujie, blames overdevelopment and global warming. He says just 20 years ago the river was lined with trees, “I played in the river when I was a kid,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Parts of that dried-up river bed are now celery fields as prices for the crop have risen in the last few years, meaning the water-hungry vegetable is much more widely planted. Gao says he understands but disapproves of this choice: “Those of us who study water know this is a problem, but growing celery does increase incomes for farmers.”</p>
<p>The fragile environment forces more use of natural resources to increase harvests, meaning poverty, population, environment all become interlinked.</p>
<p>Wang Yiming explains that relocations are intended to reduce demand for natural resources – mainly water – to a sustainable level. It isn’t about retreating, Wang says, it’s a necessary compromise between humankind and nature.<br />
And in the parts of Xiji emptied a year or more ago, alfalfa – an important source of forage for livestock – and wild grasses now sprout up into the warm air.</p>
<h2>New homes, new problems</h2>
<p>But life in the new villages isn’t as good as was hoped. In some cases, the new homes are smaller than those relocated villagers have left, while newer residents complain about problems with bureaucracy, farming, jobs, and other sources of income.</p>
<p>Fan Jianrong, a professor at the Beifang University of Nationalities, who has researched relocation of communities, finds that older villagers are the most despondent about the prospect of moving and have the biggest problems in adapting to new homes.</p>
<p>Guoqing’s uncle Ma Cunzi is 45, for instance, and wants to stay in Luziwo despite a final government ultimatum to leave. He even planted potatoes and wheat as soon as the weather was right.</p>
<p>The family’s new home is in Miaomiao Lake’s District 7. His mother, Ma Cuifang, has been here for several months, but doesn’t like to leave the village as she can’t read and doesn’t know many of the neighbours. His father, Ma Bingwu, spends his time thinking about the cows and fields he used to have.</p>
<p>Now, he says, he’s “useless” to the family. He rides a borrowed bike to the vegetable market, but comes home empty-handed and complaining about the prices. “It’s all more expensive here than in Xiji. It was 0.50 yuan for a kilogramme of potatoes there, and 1 yuan here!”</p>
<p>And it is not just older people that can’t settle here. Younger residents have become increasingly anxious about jobs and opportunities.</p>
<p>The town’s Party secretary’s home is full of people who come to ask about work or complain of various problems.</p>
<p>“The government moved us here, and now we don’t know what we’re meant to be doing,” says someone in the crowd, to general agreement.</p>
<p>Wang Xinglong of the Pingluo county labour and employment bureau explained that “on one hand you’ve got companies in the area that can’t find the workers they need, and on the other hand, many relocated villagers can’t secure suitable work.”</p>
<p>The government’s decision to cut off transport and logistical links to villagers’ original homes has caused controversy amongst academics.</p>
<p>Meng Huixin, a post-doctoral student at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ Institute of Urban Development and the Environment, said success of the Ningxia relocation effort will be crucial for China to demonstrate capacity to adapt to climate change.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a trans-Himalayan region that receives less than 200 millimeters of rain a year, erratic rain and snowfall have led to a deepening water crisis.</p>
<p>Known formerly as the Kingdom of Lo, and open to outsiders only in 1992, Upper Mustang still has an air of mystery around it. Bordering China on the north and situated in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, it is famous for its arid mountains, steep cliffs and dry ochre-coloured landscape. The region is heavily influenced by Tibetan culture, as is evident by the many monasteries, prayer wheels and Chortens (shrines), spread throughout its villages.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jordan Valley, which encompasses modern day Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, has long been considered the region’s food basket. But the once cascading waters of the Jordan River – the lifeblood of its fertile grounds – have been reduced in many places to a mere trickle, victim of transboundary squabbling over water rights that is devastating the traditional livelihoods of the region’s Palestinian farmers.</p>
<p>Now it’s climate change that is exacting a heavy toll.</p>
<p>Captured by the Israelis from Jordan in 1967, the valley has become a central issue in recent peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. To Israel, it’s as a critical piece of their defense and intelligence capabilities, while many Palestinians say the occupation isn’t about security, but access to resources. According to World Bank estimates, tight Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to agricultural land and water resources in the Jordan Valley is costing the Palestinian economy more than $700 million per year.</p>
<p>But historically low rainfall rates and warming temperatures are placing additional pressure on disputed water resources. In recent years, dozens of aquifers have dried up and many fear the Jordan Valley, which lies 100 to 450 meters below sea level, will turn into an arid desert if water is eventually depleted.</p>
<div id="attachment_370" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-370" class="size-full wp-image-370" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-2.jpg" alt="The barren village of Fayasel in the Jordan Valley (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-370" class="wp-caption-text">The barren village of Fasayel in the Jordan Valley (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>According to a recent report issued by the Palestinian Environmental Center, this past summer was the hottest in decades. Temperatures rose 10 degrees Celsius over monthly averages in Jericho and other parts of the Jordan Valley, in some cases surpassing 50ºC (about 122ºF).</p>
<p>For the valley’s Palestinian farmers, water is already a scarce commodity. Many say there is often not enough water for basic necessities, let alone enough for their livestock or to practice traditional year-round cultivation.</p>
<p>“About 20 years ago, agriculture flourished in my village and we were self-sufficient,” says Mahmoud Saleh Suleiman, a 64-year-old farmer. “But during the past few years, water started to gradually dry up for many reasons.” One of those reasons, he believes, is climate change. “Especially in summer,” he says, “the temperature has increased, drying up water aquifers.”</p>
<p>The head of the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, Adalah Atiri, says that prevailing drought conditions are having a major impact in the West Bank, in turn affecting the food and agricultural sector. “We assume the worst possibilities to enable us to tackle issues such as a fall in rainfall of 10-20 percent by 2020 as a result of climate change,” Atiri says, “Work is needed to find solutions and adapt to these changes.”</p>
<h2>Challenging political environment</h2>
<p>But any solutions that ignore the complex political realities on the ground are insufficient.</p>
<p>Approximately 80,000 Palestinians live in the Jordan Valley, but strict Israeli measures restrict them from accessing 94 percent of available land, according to a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. Instead, Israel has allocated the majority of the valley’s land, about 86 percent, to regional councils who protect the interests of its 9,500 Israeli settlers. According to World Bank estimates, each settler receives an average of 300 liters per capita per day, about four times the amount available to Palestinians across the West Bank.</p>
<p>Villages that used to sustainably produce crops have seen their once abundant supplies of water dry up, much of it diverted to the nearby farms of Israeli settlers. Wells are often antiquated and in desperate need of repair, but it’s difficult to get the necessary permits to fix them as many lie in Area C – a security zone where Israel maintains full control.</p>
<p>In Suleiman’s hometown of Fasayel, more than 95 percent of the village’s 2,000 residents are farmers, but due to chronic water shortages, local agricultural production has ceased completely. Many now work for Israeli farms along the outskirts of the town, an industry that has been sharply criticized by human rights groups for labor violations.</p>
<p>“While the village population has doubled during the last twenty years,” Suleiman says, “our share of water has remained the same and we are obliged to buy water to meet our daily needs, as well as needs for cultivation.” But this resource comes at a steep price.</p>

<p>Dr. Abdel Rahman Tamimi, director of the Palestinian Hydology Group, says that continuous reductions in water supplies have forced Palestinians to buy water from the Israeli authorities at inflated prices. The price of one cubic meter of treated water is 5 shekels, Tamimi says, “but the Israelis take advantage of Palestinian demand for water and sell it at 25 shekels for one cubic meter, especially in Hebron and the Jordan Valley area, where people spend around 12 percent of their monthly income on water.”</p>
<p>According to Tamimi, factors such as climate change and Israeli control over supply have restricted daily individual consumption from an average of 80 liters to only 40. In some cases it’s much less, but each is below the 100 liters per day recommended by the World Health Organization. “In southern Hebron,” he says, “the per capita share of water is only 10 liters and people in that area are obliged to buy water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmer Youself Sawafta owns several <em>dunums </em>of land in Bardala (each <em>dunum </em>is equal to 100 square meters), the lowest agricultural strip on earth. The last three years, he says, have been some of the most difficult due to the adverse effects of hot weather on agriculture and water supplies. Despite his best efforts to reduce reliance on water-intensive crops, his output remains meager. “For more than a year, we have been trying to cultivate crops that do not need much water, such as barley,” he says. “We barely have sufficient water for our daily use, let alone cultivation.”</p>
<p>Sawafta says that tight restrictions on what little water is available for agriculture only makes things worse. “In the past, we were allowed to extract 400 cubic meters per hour,” he says. “The occupation allocated us only 80 cubic meters per hour, which is insufficient to cultivate any type of vegetable.”</p>
<div id="attachment_386" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/7-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386" class="size-full wp-image-386" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/7-5.jpg" alt="A well in Bardah that is controlled by the Israeli water company Makarot (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7-5-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-386" class="wp-caption-text">A well in Bardalah that is controlled by the Israeli water company Mekorot (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>What does remain is cost prohibitive for most Palestinian farmers. Sawafta says his annual water bill is more than 100 thousand shekels (approximately $26,000) and he depends on help from international aid organizations to cover the bill. But it’s a high sum for the poor agricultural region, where the average annual per capita income is $2,000.</p>
<p>According to Sawafta, Israeli authorities have reduced the volume of water allocated to Bardala since 2000 in order to supply nearby settlements. Two wells built before 1967 to provide the village with water are fitted with meters to monitor use. A guard, he says, prevents anyone from approaching them. Deeper wells dug by Israel’s National Water Company, Mekorot, are close by.</p>
<h2>A region-wide problem?</h2>
<p>Mekorot director Ori Shani disputes the notion that Israel is the cause of water shortages faced by Palestinians. Severe drought, he says, is putting pressure not only on the West Bank, but also Israel and other neighboring countries. “Climate change has affected the volume of water and the seasons,” says Shani, “some seasons have become longer than others, causing drought in certain areas and less water in springs, a phenomenon that did not previously exist.”</p>
<p>He says visible impacts such as reduced water levels in the Sea of Galilee (Tiberias Lake) have prompted both sides to seek solutions, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been negligent in its approach to solving the crisis.</p>
<p>“The PA has not attempted to reduce water consumption by the public and has also failed to implement any projects to tackle the water shortage, such as the treatment of wastewater for cultivation purposes,” he says. “This can reduce the water shortage by 30 percent, exactly as it has done in Israel.”</p>
<p>Reduced water to villages is therefore not a problem with supply, he says, but with demand. “We supply Palestinians with double the quantity of water stipulated in agreements signed between Palestinians and Israelis,” says Shani, “the quantity of water supplied to areas inside the Green Line is much higher than that supplied to settlements.”</p>
<p>Humanitarian organizations estimate that 100,000 <em>dunums</em> of agricultural land in the Jordan Valley is affected by water shortages, forcing many farmers each year to pack up and leave. Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) head Mazen Ghneim acknowledges that climate change has played a role in reducing underground aquifers and increasing drought, but says the crisis would be greatly reduced if Israel ceased control over the valley’s water supply. According to PWA estimates, the average Palestinian in the Jordan Valley receives an average daily share of 30 liters, compared to the daily per capita share of 500 liters for an Israeli settler.</p>
<div id="attachment_389" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389" class="size-full wp-image-389" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8-3.jpg" alt="An outdated Palestinian well in Bardalah (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/8-3-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-389" class="wp-caption-text">An outdated Palestinian well in Bardalah (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>The way Ghneim sees it, Palestinians face few choices – either buy water back from Israel at inflated prices or attempt to renovate outdated wells. The second option is difficult and requires approval from the Israeli government, he says, which comes few and far between. But Mekorot’s Ori Shani says that it’s the Palestinian Authority government that’s been slow to begin approved renovations. “In the Joint Palestinian-Israeli Water Committee,” he says, “we Israelis agreed to renovate 60 wells in the West Bank, but the PA has not yet started the implementation of these projects.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that there is no simple solution to easing water woes in the Jordan Valley. Despite their low carbon footprint, Palestinians also have little control over emissions that climate scientists say are warming the planet and contributing to the warmer temperatures and prolonged drought, conditions that Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority head Atir says makes them doubly victimized.</p>
<p>“Emissions produced by Palestine are almost zero as Palestine does not have factories,” she says. “Israel also does not allow Palestinians to exploit underground water aquifers located within their land, which is a double blow.”</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Yumao is a community in the Bolivian Great Chaco where women and children must walk up to eight kilometers a day to collect water from the Rio Grande, an increasingly complicated feat in times of a changing climate.
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lupe Cuellar awoke to the noisy singing of a group of <em>charatas</em>, a bird native to the Chaco region. It was time to set off for the Rio Grande before the afternoon sun made the trip unbearable.</p>
<p>Each morning, she makes the three to four hour journey to collect enough water to meet her family’s daily needs. As she prepares to leave, the family’s 23-year-old donkey <em>Jincho</em> stands by her side with two empty containers strapped to his back, just about all the aging animal can carry home.</p>
<p>Outside, her three young boys play in the dusty yard with the family’s chickens. They are too young to make the journey, but her eldest son Roberto Carlos has finished his homework and will accompany her on the long trip. He is ten years old.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1raRdgUckE&#038;w=560&#038;h=315]</p>
<p>The 22 families living in Yumao are considered to be some of the poorest in Bolivia, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The community is located in the municipality of Gutierrez in the Bolivian Great Chaco, home to 44 indigenous communities. About 90 percent of the municipality´s population belongs to the Guarani ethnic group. Yumao has the lowest rate of income per household and lacks basic needs such as food, water, and sanitation.</p>
<p>Lupe is not alone on her long trek to the Rio Grande. Every day, Yumao women must walk an average of six to eight daily kilometers, some even up to 15 kilometers, to collect drinking water. Some must make the journey twice to collect enough water for their families and farm animals, as well as to cook and clean. This daily feat far exceeds World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that say water sources must be less than a thousand meters from home and collection time should not exceed 30 minutes.</p>
<p>A person needs between 50 and 100 liters of water per day to ensure that basic health needs are met and an additional two liters a day are required for safe food preparation. In Yumao, one person must survive on an average of 13 liters of water per day—37 liters less than the minimum established.</p>
<h2><strong>Not a drop to waste</strong></h2>
<p>“Each drop of water is worth a lot to us, we do not waste anything,” says Braulio Alvarez after returning from a second trip to get enough water for his family of nine, his ten hens, and four pigs. “When we are not going to use a glass of water we give it to our chickens, that&#8217;s enough to quench the thirst of up to two hens. We cannot waste any water, the trip to the river is very hard.”</p>
<p>Five of Yumao’s 22 families are lucky enough to have a water distribution system that uses gravity to funnel water from a stream across the mountains. But it’s not a solution that works for everyone. Many families have settled on ground that is too flat for the system to work and must follow the arduous process of water gathering done traditionally by the women and older children in the family. Because the need for water is so great, the men now often leave the crop fields to join the long walk to the river.</p>
<div id="attachment_377" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-377" class="wp-image-377 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river.png" alt="Roberto Carlos and his father going to the river" width="589" height="391" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river.png 589w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river-300x199.png 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roberto-Carlos-and-his-father-going-to-the-river-272x182.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-377" class="wp-caption-text">Roberto Carlos and his father going to the Rio Grande to collect water (Credit: Eduardo Franco Berton)</p></div>
<p>Not only is water from the Rio Grande difficult to collect, but it’s also dirty and must undergo a filtering process to make it safe to drink. Residents beat leaves from the <em>caraguatá </em>(a native plant to the Great Chaco) with stones to extract a resin that is then mixed with the muddy liquid. The mixture must sit for no longer than five to ten minutes to clean the water, but avoid picking up a bitter taste. Once it’s filtered, it must be further boiled to avoid waterborne diseases. About 10% of the river mixture is mud and must be discarded.</p>
<p>Though residents are aware of the dangers of drinking contaminated water, these methods are sometimes not enough to protect the community from harmful bacteria and chemicals in their water supply. Ely Zarate, a woman of small stature but great courage and strength, is Yumao’s <em>Mburuvicha</em>, which means leader in the Guarani language. With misty eyes, she recalls when her seven children suffered from gastrointestinal and skin diseases due to the water. “I thank God my children got better,” she says. “They were very sick.”</p>
<p>According to Zarate, the river water is often tainted with insecticide runoff during the rainy season, causing the death of fish along the shore. When people enter the contaminated river, she says, they get rashes on their skin.</p>
<p>Threats to the Yumao community don’t only come from the water. In the past, Zarate says, children who have gone to help their mothers bring water home become ill with fever and severe headaches due to the intense heat of the afternoon sun. Crops, she says, are also being affected. &#8221;We have less forest that refreshes the air…where there is no forest cover it’s much hotter,” says Ely Zarate. “Our climate has changed a lot and that is affecting the water provision and our crops.”</p>
<p>And temperatures in the Great Chaco are predicted to rise. New climatic research from the Nature Friends Foundation (FAN) projects that temperatures could increase up to 1.43 °C in the Bolivian Chaco until the year 2030, this rise is predicted to occur during the wet season. This temperature is predicted to bring significant changes to the ecosystem and its natural resources, and put additional stress on the dwindling water supply.</p>
<h2><strong>Urgency in the Great Chaco</strong></h2>
<p>The Great American Chaco is the second largest forest region of Latin America after the Amazon, and the largest continuous dry forest in the world. Its diverse habitats range from swamps, lagoons and sub-humid forests in the east, to grasslands and dry forests in the west. These environments harbor a high diversity of plant and animal species, including 150 types of mammals, 500 birds, 186 amphibian species, 297 reptiles, and 3,400 plant species, of which 400 are endemic. The Chaco region spans just over one million square kilometers, with 46% located in Argentina, 34% in Paraguay, 20% in Bolivia, and a small fraction in Brazil.</p>
<p>According to the Chaco Network (a regional group made up of 15 NGOs from Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina), this large forest area is particularly important as a global carbon sink, with the potential to sequester an estimated one billion tons of carbon annually with proper sustainable land and ecosystem management. But the Great Chaco is also considered a fragile ecosystem due to the limited rainfall and high temperatures, a major blow to the population that already suffers from one of the lowest human development indices in the region.</p>
<p>In its recently released plan to reduce greenhouse gases ahead of the Paris climate summit, the Bolivian government stated that commitments from developing countries would depend on the provision of financial resources and technology transfer from their developed counterparts. According to Yumao residents, however, it’s their government that isn’t doing enough. Economic support, they say, is urgently needed in order to solve chronic water shortages they face in the region.</p>
<p>Where the Bolivian government has fallen short, other groups are stepping in to try and ease the Chaco water crisis. Recently, some families in Yumao have been benefiting from a project designed to help them harvest rainwater by the Development Area Project (PDA) organization. The system allows them to collect rain by using a tank installed on their roof that drains into a larger 5,000 liter receptacle. When the rain does fall, it provides welcome relief. A full tank of collected water—though rare—can last up to two to three months, depending on the size and needs of the family.</p>
<div id="attachment_375" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-375" class="size-full wp-image-375" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao.jpg" alt="Children of Yumao (Credit: Eduardo Franco Berton)" width="589" height="889" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao.jpg 589w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao-199x300.jpg 199w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Children-of-Yumao-530x800.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-375" class="wp-caption-text">Children of Yumao (Credit: Eduardo Franco Berton)</p></div>
<p>Residents can also get bi-monthly shipments of water, but the cost is steep. Trucks can distribute an average of 12,000 liters of water to four families at a cost of 500 bolivianos—equivalent to 71 USD—but can only come every two months because of high demand across the municipality of Gutierrez. One average, the shipments can last a family of six for up to two weeks, but the number of animals a family must provide for can greatly reduce this outlook.</p>
<p>While there is an urgent need for infrastructure investment in Yumao, the price tag is expensive. The community’s remaining 17 families who don’t have access to a water system have no choice but to make the daily trip to the river, with no guarantee that the water they are drinking is clean. A proposal to drill water wells for the irrigation of crops could reduce the amount of water needed to be carried back, but it costs an estimated $15,000, money that is not in the budget of Yumao, nor the municipality of Gutierrez.</p>
<h2><strong>Golden grain at risk</strong></h2>
<p>Corn—Yumao’s “golden grain”—is the backbone of the community’s economy and culture, but with little available water, it’s becoming more and more difficult to produce. Despite the region’s extreme conditions, farmers pride themselves on producing some of the country’s best. <em>“Chicha</em>,” a corn drink, is consumed during meals and they also used corn seeds to feed chickens, making the crop an important staple for the community. But unlike other eco regions in Bolivia where farmers can produce a harvest twice a year, in Yumao they can only grow corn once a year due to poor moisture conditions.</p>
<p>Yumao’s residents still recall when they could spend all day working in the fields. These days, the afternoon sun can reach a scorching 47 °C, making it impossible to work. Farmers get up at dawn and often have to quit by nine or ten in the morning to wait out the heat.</p>
<p>“Our economy and daily lives are devoted to agriculture, the livelihood of our families are based on the sowing and harvesting of corn<em>,</em>” says Freddy Lara, who is in charge of agricultural programs in the municipality of Gutierrez. He says that changes in the weather have also altered the corn planting season. Planting used to take place in November, but now can be as late as March because of delayed rains.</p>
<p>The long, hot days can also damage corn seeds, which increase the production costs for Yumao’s ailing farmers, who have to buy replacement seed at higher market prices. These unexpected costs can threaten the family’s ability to pay for important expenses, such as health care and education, forcing some people to leave the community in the search of work.</p>
<p>“My dream is to become a teacher when I am older, I would like to teach other children what I learn,” says Lupe Cuellar’s 10-year-old son Roberto Carlos. His hopeful eyes and charismatic smile shine under a big camouflaged hat. Under the proud gaze of his father, he recites a poem he wrote that reached the final round of a national poetry competition. Across the yard, the laughter of his brothers can be heard as they chase one another around the water tank.</p>
<p>On the horizon, the sun begins to set on the Great Chaco, snapping the intense heat for the remainder of the day. Roberto Carlos looks over at <em>Jincho</em> and the donkey begins to fidget at his post. It will soon be time to return to the river.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahmed Rizq watched the mercury on his thermometer rise: 48, 53…55 degrees Celsius. It rose higher than he had ever seen it rise before. And then it stayed there—for over three weeks. Rizq had lived in Aswan in the very south of Egypt his whole life; he could take a little heat. But August 2015 was a new kind of hot. It was the sort of hot that could kill you.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health began distributing flyers to hospitals all around the country, encouraging citizens to stay at home if possible and avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. But those flyers never reached the desert village of Ladid, and even if they had, they wouldn’t have made a difference, said Rizq, who researches public health access for the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights. “The village is close to a mountain in the desert,” Rizq described. “There isn’t a water source inside, you’re outside the agricultural area by some kilometers.”</p>
<div id="attachment_16" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/1-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16" class="size-large wp-image-16" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/1-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Near the Sudan border, Aswan endures some of the highest temperatures in Egypt.

Despite the cool Nile winding alongside the city, many residents suffer from heatstroke and even death in the summer months. (Credit: Nicholas Linn)</p></div>
<p>Ladid, like most small Egyptian villages, is served by a modest medical center. In general, these centers are well equipped but lack the staff to run them, Rizq said, because anyone who can get enough medical experience to get out of his village usually does. The closest hospital is in Edfu, about an hour and a half away by public transport. By mid-August, Ladid residents were shuttling their sick and dying to and from Edfu, Luxor and Aswan general hospitals. “They were taking people one after the other to the hospital,” Rizq said. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.”</p>
<p>Ladid was hardly the only village to be overwhelmed by the crushing heat. As August crept along and the heatwave persisted, the city hospitals became overrun as patients poured in from surrounding rural villages. Heat stroke, dehydration, high blood pressure, heart attacks: the cases kept on coming and the hospitals soon ran out of beds. The <a href="https://www.google.com.eg/maps/place/Luxor+International+Hospital/@25.6872365,32.6401085,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x582cf806bf20672?sa=X&amp;ved=0CHIQ_BIwDWoVChMI9Kf4kP7byAIVSg8aCh3uLgNH">Luxor International Hospital,</a> widely considered to be the best hospital south of Assiut, was overflowing.</p>
<p>“The emergency wing can treat up to 300 patients at a time, 50 at a time in the ICU,” said an emergency room doctor who asked not to be named, as he had been instructed not to speak to the press about the heatwave. “We were always full. People had to wait.”</p>
<p>The death toll began to rise. By the second week of August, <a href="http://www.vetogate.com/1768105">13 Ladid residents had died</a>, according to local journalist Doaa Ibrahim. “They would take them to the local medical center and then to the hospital in Edfu and they would die there or on the way,” Ibrahim said. “But the government didn’t count these as heat-related deaths. They said they died of high blood pressure or liver problems or heart problems.”</p>
<p>And so when the Ministry of Health announced the official tally of heatwave casualties later that week, Ladid’s dead were not counted among them. As it stands, the official death toll for entire country stopped at <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/08/22/ministry-of-health-denies-meningitis-outbreak-in-luxor-following-deaths/">110 this summer</a>, with a mere <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/138650/Egypt/Politics-/Four-die-in-Egypts-Aswan-due-to-continued-heatwave.aspx">11 casualties</a> from Aswan, but dozens, if not hundreds more have gone unaccounted for, Rizq said. “They say [the Ladid villagers] died of natural causes, but how can you tell me 13 people from the same place died in one week from natural causes?” Rizq said.</p>
<div id="attachment_27" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27" class="size-large wp-image-27" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/4-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ahmed Rizq, an Egyptian public health researcher and lawyer, told Al Monitor that there were at least 50 heat-related deaths in the Aswan governorate alone this past summer. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.” (Credit: Nicholas Linn)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-27" class="wp-caption-text">Ahmed Rizq, an Egyptian public health researcher and lawyer, told Al Monitor that there were at least 50 heat-related deaths in the Aswan governorate alone this past summer. “There was a very high number and the hospital had far more people than it was equipped to handle.” (Credit: Nicholas Linn)</p></div>
<p>The emergency room doctor at the Luxor International Hospital confirmed that plenty of heatstroke cases went undocumented. “Officially, we maybe had 5 diagnosed cases a day of heatstroke, but we certainly saw a noticeable rise in heat deaths this summer, even if not all were documented,” he said. “Each doctor has to make his own diagnosis. One could write ‘heat stroke’ and the other could write ‘acute renal failure’ and he wouldn’t necessarily be wrong.”</p>
<p>When Al Monitor asked the hospital deputy director Nahed Ahmed Mohammed for the official number of heatstroke patients and casualties from this summer, he declined to comment.</p>
<p>“All I know is what we observe, and that’s that when the temperature goes up, the number of deaths goes up,” said Aswan resident Khaled Sadek, “We don’t have conclusive proof that the heat was what caused the death. And so that’s what you see in the government studies. Hospitals, when they get cases like these, have a lot of causes they can pick from. But that’s not actually helpful for researching the problem and understanding what’s going on here.”</p>
<p>What’s going on here, in a nutshell, is that Aswan, along with the rest of Egypt is getting hotter with every passing year. As of 2010, <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/ccl16/teco/documents/ppt/TECO-Presentations-PDF/01-7-2014/Session6/1500-1520/4-Presentation1for_conf_1jul.pdf">data from the Egyptian Meteorological Authority</a> showed that Egypt’s five hottest years in recorded history have occurred from the year 2002 onward. The data also showed that heatwaves are becoming more common and prolonged. From 2001 to 2010, Aswan recorded over 100 days with temperatures in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or higher—whereas in the 70s, that number was closer to 40, the study showed.</p>
<p>And as this past summer revealed, the heat is starting to take its toll. Rizq estimated that there were no fewer than 50 deaths in the Aswan governorate alone—but these casualties are just the tip of the iceberg. Bahaa George, an obstetrician at the more modest Luxor General Hospital, said the heat is proving damaging to unborn children and their mothers.</p>
<p>“When you are pregnant, you are particularly at risk of dehydration,” George said. “It can severely affect the amniotic fluid. If the mother is dehydrated, she will draw her amniotic fluid from her urine. There will also be comparatively less blood flow to the fetus and the baby’s immunity will be lower.”</p>
<p>While George said it was too soon for him to have noticed any trends in maternal or infant mortality as a result, he did say the heat was negatively affecting his patients and could cause further problems down the road.</p>
<p>For several years after they’re born, children remain particularly at risk of heat stroke and dehydration and parents are encouraged to keep them at home if temperatures climb to over 40 degrees. This will have a profound effect on elementary education rates, Sadek said. “A child can’t go out and play in the streets, he can’t go to school. And when he does go to school, he doesn’t learn anything. Most schools here don’t even have a fan,” Sadek said.</p>

<p>Additionally, rising temperatures risk leading to an increase in parasitical diseases, according to Wael Lotfy, a professor of parasitology at the faculty of Medical Research in Alexandria University. What worries him most is the possibility that in the next three or four decades, malaria could be reintroduced to Egypt if malaria-carrying mosquitoes begin to migrate north from Sudan.</p>
<p>“With global warming it is possible that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/"><em>Anapholese gambiae</em></a> [a malaria carrying mosquito] expands its range of distribution to Egypt, and hence introduces the parasite to the country,” Lotfy said. The mosquito has already been reported in Aswan and Toshka, though it was not carrying malaria.</p>
<p>In addition to malaria, Egypt could see a resurgence of <a href="http://www.who.int/schistosomiasis/en/"><em>schistosomiasis</em></a>, a disease caused by tiny worms burrowing their way through the human vascular system, harming the liver, bladder and blood vessels. The worms are carried by a particular variety of snail that thrives in warm, stagnant water. As the flow of water through the Nile and its canals lessens, Lotfy expects to see an increase in these snails, accompanied by an increase in <em>schistosomiasis</em> cases. Now more than ever, the Ministry of Health needs to ensure the accurate reporting of parasitical diseases and monitor their spread, Lotfy said. Other than that though, there isn’t much anyone can do but wait and see.</p>
<p>That’s what’s hardest for Sedky: to know the future of his homeland is out of his hands.</p>
<p>“Most of these poor people aren’t part of the problem: they use simple tools that don’t hurt the environment. But then the end result is a lot of problems that fall on them,” Sedky said. “I don’t want to live in a skyscraper. I just want to live on an island with water around me and clean environment beneath me. You can live in a skyscraper if you want but don’t you choose something that’s going to hurt me in the end. Live the way you want to live but don’t live in such a way that will hurt me here.”</p>

<p>Seventeen-year-old Virginia Pushaina drops an orange bucket into the murky depths of an open pit to collect muddy water.

Crops of corn and beans have long since shriveled to dust, and emaciated goats scrounging for food in the sand no longer can feed a family or fetch a good price at market.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Six months pregnant, Pushaina often thinks about the baby son she lost to an infection two years ago. She now fears for her young daughter, who often lacks clean water and receives little nourishment apart from a few swallows of <i>chicha</i>, a fermented corn drink.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Since the region’s crippling drought began three years ago, 12 children among Pushaina&#8217;s hundred extended family members have died from malnutrition, dehydration, or illnesses caused by consuming dirty, stagnant water from the earthen wells. Many mothers in this indigenous Wayúu community on the Caribbean desert peninsula of Guajira are so malnourished that they are unable to produce milk for their babies.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Long before dawn breaks, women from the <i>ranchería</i> of Porciosa set out into the night with battered plastic containers, walking for hours across the sweltering desert to retrieve clean water from the nearest potable wells. They haul it back by burro or on bicycles, or lacking those, they carry it themselves. If they can&#8217;t carry enough to meet their families&#8217; needs, they must resort to consuming water from Porciosa&#8217;s two pit wells, which are contaminated with bacteria. It&#8217;s an arduous daily ritual carried out in Wayúu rancherías, or settlements, across the state of La Guajira.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The word <i>víctima</i> in Colombia has a strong association with the country&#8217;s long-running armed conflict. But as the Colombian government moves steadily toward a peace accord, it is grappling with how to respond to a new kind of victim—people forced from their homes as they suffer the effects of higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more extreme droughts and floods.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The Wayúu&#8217;s plight underscores a broader challenge for Colombia: analyzing the climate-related tipping points that could make people already suffering poverty, conflict, or other environmental threats more likely to migrate, particularly to its crowded cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It&#8217;s an emerging concern all around the world, yet consensus on the best ways forward remains elusive. When the United Nations climate talks commence in Paris on November 30, climate-related migration is likely to garner only a small amount of space in the accord&#8217;s text. That leaves individual countries to devise their own approaches to measuring migration and displacement and safeguarding rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Worldwide an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced each year since 2008 by natural disasters related to extreme weather and climate change, according to the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nrc.no/?aid=9137092#.VkyO-SnDbJ-">Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, part of the Norwegian Refugee Council.</a></p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;We are moving beyond the social conflict already occurring in the country toward a different vulnerability, and some of those [affected] people have no recognition and no future unless we try to understand what&#8217;s happening with migration,&#8221; says Elsa Garcia Salazar, an environmental monitor specializing in climate change at the Bogotá office of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.iom.int">International Organization for Migration</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Crisis in La Guajira</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>For centuries, the Wayúu have resourcefully adapted to seasonal dry periods by migrating within their territory, which extends across the border to Venezuela. But the region&#8217;s unprecedented drought is exacerbating the effects of armed conflict, environmental degradation, and government neglect, driving many in this tribe of some 400,000 to a point of crisis.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very critical, the situation of our community,&#8221; says Arico Pushaina, a community leader in Porciosa. &#8220;If the government doesn&#8217;t help us … the Wayúu will come to an end in this land.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Scientists at <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.ideam.gov.co/">IDEAM,</a> Colombia&#8217;s institute of hydrology and meteorology, attribute Guajira&#8217;s three-year drought to repeated El Niños, a weather phenomenon causing hot and dry conditions there. But recent research says the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n2/full/nclimate2100.html">frequency of these extreme El Niño events</a> has increased due to global warming. And with <a class="ui-link" href="http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/pubs/rp/caribbean-full-eng.pdf">more intense droughts </a>predicted for this region, the fate of the people who call this windswept desert home remains uncertain.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Across Guajira Peninsula&#8217;s 9,700 square miles, a staggering 37,000 people suffer from malnutrition, according to a <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.defensoria.gov.co/public/pdf/informedefensorialguajira11.pdf">2014 report</a> by Colombia&#8217;s Ombudsman Office. Its hunger crisis intensified in August, when Venezuela closed its border and imposed strict checkpoints to fight contraband gasoline, food, and other products flowing into Colombia. Since then, the Wayúu have found it harder to get cheaper Venezuelan goods, making a bad economy even worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The drought also is exacerbating another serious water woe: the damming of the Río Ranchería, the main river that flows through La Guajira. The river was dammed in large part to quench the voracious thirst of mining companies, resulting in its flow being cut off from the Wayúu. The Wayúu are now <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.las2orillas.co/como-llego-el-caso-wayuu-la-cidh/">petitioning</a> the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to restore their access.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>No one in Porciosa has yet migrated outside of traditional Wayúu territory. But in nearby communities, some—particularly younger people—have left for other Colombian states, according to local leaders.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Garcia wants to know whether the drought is altering the Wayúu&#8217;s traditional migration patterns and pushing them in greater numbers toward urban areas and neighboring states. There&#8217;s an urgent need, she says, for rigorous data collection tools that can aid policymakers in understanding how phenomena linked to climate change are contributing to human migration—not only in La Guajira but throughout the country.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p><a class="ui-link" href="http://www.cgdev.org/page/mapping-impacts-climate-change">One study</a> ranks Colombia 18th in the world for climate change risks—two to three times the risk of neighboring Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador: From expansive agricultural lands to urban centers in the Andes to nearly 2,000 miles of coastline, the majority of Colombians live in places likely to be affected by extreme weather, sea level rise, and other phenomena exacerbated by global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of challenges with climate change issues,&#8221; says Rodrigo Suárez Castaño, director of the climate change division at Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. &#8220;If things keep going this way, we&#8217;re going to have more people moving and more people living in cities. It&#8217;s a big question and challenge we have on our hands.&#8221;</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Colombia&#8217;s Wake-up Call</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Last year, Colombia became one of the first countries in South America to include migration in its <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.minambiente.gov.co/index.php/component/content/article/476-plantilla-cambio-climatico-32">national climate change adaptation plan</a>.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>A pivotal event for the Colombian government in recognizing the potential for climate-induced migration was the devastating, widespread La Niña floods in 2010 and 2011, which affected more than three million people throughout the country. There is no clear data on how many people were ultimately displaced, but flooding and mudslides damaged nearly 500,000 homes and affected millions of acres of agricultural lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It was a wake-up call. Following the floods, the government collaborated with the International Organization for Migration to track 2,000 people who had been displaced—an initial step toward a national climate migration study. The survey revealed trends similar to those seen in conflict displacement. Two years after the floods, nearly half had not yet returned home. Many had migrated to large cities like Medellín, Bogotá, and Cartagena.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Like those displaced by conflict, people displaced by the flooding lost property, income, and social support networks. They often settled informally on the fringe of cities in undesirable areas lacking basic infrastructure. People arriving from rural agricultural regions also tended to lack skills necessary to find jobs in an urban economy.</p>
<div id="attachment_322" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC_0662.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-image-322 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg" alt="DSC_0662" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-caption-text">Wayuu women return to Porciosa after filling plastic containers with dirty water from the village&#8217;s two artisanal wells.  (Credit: Autumn Spanne)</p></div>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The small study underscored that cities need to be prepared to receive new migrants as part of their own climate adaptation plans. So far, they lack systems for preparing for them.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Can the Cities Cope?</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Take the Colombian city of Cartagena. The city is home to tens of thousands of displaced conflict victims, many of whom settle informally along the major coastal lagoon of Cienaga de la Virgen with no sewer, water, or other municipal services. The arrival of more people because of climate-related phenomena—like flooding to the city&#8217;s south, rising seas that threaten the islands off its coast, and drought in La Guajira—will add to the pressures.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>But while Cartagena has one of the most advanced adaptation plans in the region, the city hasn&#8217;t yet developed a strategy for climate migration. Suárez says the national government is supporting such efforts by providing guidelines.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t make a commitment to getting solid data about patterns of climate migration, we will not have adequate tools for decision-making,&#8221; says Dolly González, Cartagena&#8217;s city planning director. &#8220;People who arrive in Cartagena because of climate change are staying outside of the government aid programs, because the focus has been conflict.&#8221;</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Beyond counting and tracking migrants, governments face challenges in developing legal mechanisms to provide ongoing support after initial crises like floods and fires. In Colombia, those fleeing extreme weather aren&#8217;t covered by the same laws that protect the rights of conflict-displaced migrants. So far, there isn&#8217;t even a standardized international definition of what constitutes a climate migrant.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The big question now is whether migration and displacement will be included in a new UN climate accord. Ahead of Paris, some developing nations proposed a new entity to organize humanitarian responses to climate-related disasters.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>There&#8217;s general agreement that climate migration will grow in coming decades, notes Walter Kaelin of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.nanseninitiative.org">Nansen Initiative</a>, which is working to improve international responses to people displaced by natural disasters. But providing compensation for affected countries is a sticking point. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have something in the Paris outcome, it will be much more difficult to keep this on the list of priorities,&#8221; he says.</p>

<h2><b>A Plea to Preserve a Culture</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Back in Porciosa, Virginia Pushaina watches her 19-month-old daughter grow weak and cry for food. She notices that the toddler has the same skin rash that her son developed before contracting a fatal infection. But she doesn&#8217;t have much time to dwell on such unsettling thoughts. Each day she must give herself completely to the present: tending her daughter, walking miles to fetch water, and making <i>mochilas</i>, intricately-woven cotton bags popular with tourists that have become crucial to the economic survival of many Wayúu families.</p>

<p>Arico Pushaina pleads for greater government investment, including deeper wells, new windmills and solar pumps, medical clinics, and programs that allow artisans to get a fairer price for their goods.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>He worries that, if La Guajira&#8217;s droughts become more intense and prolonged, the young will no longer be able to rely on traditional economic activities such as livestock and subsistence agriculture. What future will the Wayúu have, he wonders, if they are forced to leave for crime-ridden cities, far removed from their culture?</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>His uncertainty about the future also stems from another source. Contaminated water has contributed to the death of ten elders since the drought began, says Pushaina. With them goes their precious cultural knowledge, including the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.festival.si.edu/blog/2013/what-did-you-dream-wayuu-dream-interpretation/">Wayúu tradition</a> of using dreams to plan for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;When they interpret dreams, they inform the community about what&#8217;s to come. It has really affected us, the [loss of] elders,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We no longer know what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>
