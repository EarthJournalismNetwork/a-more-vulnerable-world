<p><em>Climate change is affecting people across the planet, however, it disproportionately impacts women, particularly those living in poor countries who are traditionally tasked with gathering food, water and fuel for the family. </em></p>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText">
<p>As climate change dries up streams and lakes, women are walking longer distances to fetch water, firewood and other domestic necessities that are vital for every day life. Farming, an activity often carried out by women in African societies, has also been affected.</p>
<p>Under searing temperatures and reduced rainfall, crops are smaller and sometimes do not grow at all. In many of these traditionally patriarchal societies, women have little influence over social and political issues. This is especially the case in northern Malawi, where women are often constrained by laws and cultural norms that limit their economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Though communities here depend on this agricultural production for both income and food, women&#8217;s access to land and ownership of land is heavily restricted. In the northern region districts of Karonga and Mzimba, for example, women are generally not allowed to own enough land for large-scale agricultural production that could promote their economic independence. Instead productive land is primarily controlled by male family members.</p>
<p>But as crops continue to struggle under the effects of climate, many women farmers have begun to lead in the practice of something known as conservation agriculture. This technology enables growers to yield much more from small pockets of land, despite warmer temperatures and erratic rains. It is, however, labor intensive and requires long hours that are often difficult to meet under the pressures of other gender-related roles.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6DEk8aw07ng" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“I always wake up early in the morning searching for food for my children and I don’t find time to concentrate in the garden let alone to take part in the new ways of farming. I am aware of conservation agriculture and I know women who take part, but it’s difficult and so involving I can’t do it alone,&#8221; said Jenipher Tchongwe, who is a mother of four. She added that if she had a husband to take care of some of the family’s needs, she would have taken part in conservation agriculture.</p>
<p>Some women have started growing crops that don’t need much water, such as hybrid maize instead of local varieties They are also using manure, soil and water management, pit growing, soil cover and minimum tillage among other methods.Despite being a widow with seven children, Jessica Kaluwa, is a farmer who is leading in the practice of conservation agriculture. She began to experiment with these methods in 2012 to see if they would work.</p>
<p>“I saw others around my area doing it. I then told myself to give it a try and it really worked for me,” Kaluwa said. She added that since conservation agriculture requires so much time, one must commit. “As a woman, it’s a challenge to concentrate since there are so many other duties I have to fulfill since I have no husband to take up other challenges,&#8221; she added. But she was quick to point out that women could make more of an impact in the agricultural sector if only they had the same land ownership rights as men.</p>
<p>Winnie Ngulube is a mother of four, who is taking part in irrigation farming. She manages to harvest twice a year and she gets all her financial needs from the activity.</p>
<p>“Irrigation farming is another way of farming which Malawians need to focus on. I have managed to raise my kids alone through this way of farming. I harvest twice a year crops like maize, sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes and I mostly sell the produce,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One advocate for women&#8217;s land rights is Chief Kyungu, a prominent leader in Karonga who is working hard to change views on land ownership. Kyungu mandated that under his jurisdiction, women could inherit their husbands’ lands.</p>
<p>“Land distribution culturally favors men since it is believed that they are bread winners. People forget that women are more responsible when it comes to family matters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are taking advantage of the current gender sensitization to change people’s mindsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security has been working on leveling the playing field for both men and women by taking legal action against those who refuse to pass land to women land through the introduction of property grabbing laws. These laws are designed to protect women, but are often subverted due to fear and intimidation in rural regions.</p>
<p>The Malawian government has also introduced so-called &#8220;50:50 campaigns&#8221; where all farmers, male or female, are given the same opportunity in taking farming roles and sponsorship. Gordon Yiwombe from the Ministry of Agriculture emphasized that things are now changing in order to help women farmers overcome long-held restrictions to land ownership.</p>
<p>“In my experience in the field of agriculture and gender,&#8221; said Yiwombe, who works as the principal gender roles and extension support services officer for the ministry, &#8220;I have observed that women farmers produce more than men if they are given the same support despite facing challenges connected to gender roles.&#8221;</p>
<div style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.mbc.mw/images/YIWOMBE.bmp" alt="" width="360" height="288" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Gordon Yiwombe, Nigeria&#8217;s Ministry of Agriculture</p></div>
</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">Evidence on the ground shows that women are feeding Malawi despite the challenges of traditional societal roles and gender-based restrictions. Despite this progress, women remain vulnerable to rigid societal roles, which limits their ability to practice climate-resilient agriculture. Without these important changes, it will become more difficult for them to produce enough food to feed their families.</div>
<div class="itemFullText"></div>
<div class="itemFullText">If Malawi wants to seek solutions to changing climatic conditions, it should empower its women to lead the way.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“The rains didn’t start until June this year,” says Laadi Danladi, clutching water leaves in her hands as she peered across her fields. “By June or July, we should have started harvesting and eating. But now things have changed.” Danladi, a member of Nigeria’s Gbagyi indigenous group, has been farming for four years, but like other rural women employed in the country’s agricultural sector, she faces growing threats from warming temperatures and erratic rainfall.</p>
<p>Across Africa, climate change is having a major impact on agricultural production and food security, but in rural Nigeria where women make up over 60% of the sector, its disrupting livelihoods and traditional practices.</p>
<div id="attachment_534" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-image-534 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png" alt="LAADI DANLADI" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LAADI-DANLADI-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-534" class="wp-caption-text">Gbagyi farmer Laadi Danladi says the weather patters are changing. &#8220;By June or July we should have started harvesting and eating, but now things have changed.&#8221; (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>The Gbagyi nation is an ethnic group found in north-central Nigeria. According to National Population Census figures, there is an estimated population of 5.8 million spread across four states: Kaduna, Nassarawa, Niger, Kwara as well as Abuja, the federal capital. They are traditionally farmers, hunters and craftsmen.</p>
<p>Women play a significant role in Gbagyi society and are typically responsible for about 70% of household food production, as well as child rearing, but they remain a marginalized group in Nigeria as they attempt to adapt to the changing climate.</p>
<h2><strong>Unpredictable rain, unreliable harvest<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The Gbgayi women primarily practice subsistence agriculture, which means that they produce enough to feed themselves and their families. Warming temperatures and changes to the yearly rain cycle, however, are disrupting these customary methods. Typically the rainy season starts in spring, but each year seems to bring a later start and inconsistent rainfall for crops.</p>
<p>Like Danladi, 25-year-old bean farmer Godiah Williams is also a member of Nigeria’s Gbagyi minority. She says the unsteady, unpredictable weather patterns have caused the farmers financial ruin.</p>
<p>“We need the government to come and help us with money and fertilizer, so we can farm well, and send our children to school.”</p>
<div id="attachment_542" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" class="size-large wp-image-542" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-768x1024.jpg" alt="A Gbagyi woman working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="760" height="1013" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-225x300.jpg 225w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-542" class="wp-caption-text">A Gbagyi woman working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>In some cases, it’s not just the lack of rain that’s causing problems for Gbgayi farmers.</p>
<p>“Last year, the rains came late and the volume was too much. Many of our crops including guinea corn and even yams did not turn out well. They came out small and spoilt,” laments Salamatu, a Gbagyi farmer in Lugbe, a satellite town outside the federal capital, Abuja.</p>
<p>Many women in this region blame the climactic shift on the actions of a higher power and say they are praying to God to help them through the crisis. For others, like yam farmer Kande James, they are not even sure it exists and blame bad weather as a sort of punishment for bad habits.</p>
<p>“It’s only you educated people that talk about climate change,” says James. “We inflict this situation on ourselves. When people steal from farms where they have not planted, what do you expect; we are the ones bringing it upon ourselves.”</p>
<div id="attachment_538" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-538" class="size-full wp-image-538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png" alt="Kande James says she isn't sure climate change exists (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-2-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-538" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;We inflict this situation on ourselves,&#8221; says Kande James when talking about the changing weather patterns  (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>John Baaki, a programme officer with the Abuja-based Women Environmental Programme, has worked with rural women in north-central Nigeria and says greater access to information and data is key to overcoming climactic challenges.</p>
<p>“In order to save them the stress of predicting wrongly, it’s better to rely on the information given by the meteorological agency,” he says. “We always advocate that NIMET (the Nigerian Meteorological Agency) should partner closely with the media.”</p>
<h2><strong>Conditions driving conflict<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>It’s not just the weather patterns affecting the harvest of Nigeria’s Gbagyi farmers. Herdsmen from the country’s hard-hit northern fringes are slowly pushing south, creating greater competition for land, as reduced rainfall leaves little for their cattle to eat. With increased land scarcity and limited agronomical potential, unprecedented conflicts have erupted between local farmers and nomadic herdsmen.</p>
<p>In the Lugbe area of Abuja, herdsmen can be seen moving across the land in search of pasture. While each refused to speak to us, the farmers said they are responsible for the chronic destruction and theft of crops. Kande James says that virtually all the yams she planted that season had been stolen. They had not even matured.</p>
<p>Priscilla Achakpa, the Director of the Women Environmental Programme, says that migrating herdsmen should return to grazing routes and reserves that were proposed by the Nigerian government, a policy which has not been enforced over the years. But she acknowledges that efforts to implement adaptation strategies have been poor and often lack local context. “Most of the time,” she says, “politicians and policies that are being made ignore the indigenous knowledge of these women.”</p>
<h2>Searching for solutions</h2>
<p>As the popular saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. In circumstances of vulnerability, poverty and limited resources, many Gbagyi women have attempted to mitigate the effects of changing weather patterns on their harvests. One farmer, Patience Daniel, cut tree branches to cover her yams and prevent them from dying before the rains came. But these basic innovations are often inadequate and do little to keep crops from withering on the vine.</p>
<div id="attachment_539" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539" class="size-full wp-image-539" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png" alt="Kande James working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KANDE-JAMES-INSPECTING-YAMS-UPROOTED-UNTIMELY-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-539" class="wp-caption-text">Kande James working in her field (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>Kande James took these efforts a bit further by seeking out more dry climate-resistant crops. “[One] species of yam that grows well is the makakusa and that’s the one I have planted,” she says.</p>
<p>Corn farmer Salamatu also revealed that she was experimenting with new types of crops to combat warmer temperatures. “Agric maize (genetically modified maize) dries easily,” she says, “but our native species can withstand the heat.”</p>
<p>In a bid to ensure food security, Nigeria’s Ministry of Environment has initiated programmes that are aimed at simplifying climatic information for rural farmers – particularly women. They hope these efforts will enable them make informed decisions and safeguard their livelihoods.</p>
<p>These initiatives are also attempting to create awareness about climate change among Nigeria’s rural youth. Already, a group of ICT savvy young people has starting building “The Hive,” a SMS app that establishes paths of communication with rural women farmers to disseminate climate information and provide data on trends and predictions.</p>
<div id="attachment_545" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-545" class="size-full wp-image-545" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png" alt="Gbagyi women tending to the fields (Credit: Mary Bariki)" width="720" height="576" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2.png 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AT-WORK-2-300x240.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-545" class="wp-caption-text">Gbagyi women tending to the fields (Credit: Mary Bariki)</p></div>
<p>In a 2015 address, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared that “rural women are the backbone of sustainable livelihoods and provide food security for their families and communities.” But these women often face difficulties when it comes to obtaining critical financial resources, capacity-building activities and technologies. This lack of information and access often prevents them from taking a leadership role in climate change adaptation and mitigation in their communities. Women are also often underrepresented in the decision-making process on climate change strategies at local and international levels, painfully limiting their ability to contribute, implement solutions and apply their expertise.</p>
<p>For Gbagyi women, being better informed of climactic data and the causes and effects of climate change is essential to helping them manage finite resources and adapt their livelihood strategies to a changing environment.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abdullah Salam walks up and down his narrow plot, tossing fistfuls of wheat seeds with a light flick of his wrist as the soil squishes beneath his bare feet. “<em>Elhamdullillah,</em>” he says—praise God—a strong rain just came through and softened the ground. A month ago, this earth was as hard as asphalt.</p>
<p>These days, it feels to Salam like his soil is fighting him. It’s quick to dry out, turning hard and gray. The seeds don’t seem to like it: No matter how much money he spends on fertilizers, he’s getting slightly lower yields every harvest. And no matter how much he irrigates the land, it’s always thirsty. Always.</p>
<div id="attachment_33" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33" class="size-large wp-image-33" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="A thin white film on the sun-scorched earth in a field betrays the reason for dying crops; salt.

As the Mediterranean Sea rises due to climate change, salt seeps into Egypt’s Nile Delta, poisoning crops and ruining fresh water.  (Credit: Nicholas Linn)</p></div>
<p>But there’s nothing to be done about it, and there’s no one to complain to here in Kafr el-Sheikh, in the center of Egypt’s Nile Delta, so Salam carries on planting. He, his wife and his 15-year-old son, Mohammed, scatter the wheat seeds around his 2-acre field. Their neighbor then drives his tractor through it, tilling the soil and pushing the seeds deep into the ground. Once that’s done, they all have tea and wait.</p>
<p>“The harvest will be in five or six months, <em>inshallah</em> [God willing],” Salam says. “One [acre] used to yield 18 or 20 <em>ardab</em> [worth about $1000]. But now we’ll probably only get 10.” Salam will sell half of that at market for about $250, and the other half his wife will mill into flour and bake into bread. But it’s nearly impossible to make such a small amount of flour stretch until the next harvest, she says.</p>
<p>This land, where the Nile spreads out to meet the sea, once grew enough wheat to feed everyone from Cairo to Rome—the breadbasket of the world, they called it. Today, the delta barely feeds the farmers who cultivate it. Salam blames his diminishing returns on rising fertilizer prices and bad luck.</p>
<p>But it’s not bad luck—it’s the sea. It’s warming, rising and expanding onto the low-lying, delta lands and seeping into the water that feeds them. By the end of the century, <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">60 percent</a> of the delta region—including Salam’s field—will be so saturated with salt as to be barely farmable. As much as <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">20 percent</a> of this once-fertile land will be covered in water. When this happens, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/21/climate-change-nile-flooding-farming">two-thirds</a> of Egypt’s food will drown and two-thirds of the country’s <a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/10/10873/2013/hessd-10-10873-2013-print.pdf">population</a> will be left homeless and hungry.</p>
<h2><strong>The salt shakedown<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Sadek Mahmoud has been working the plot next to Salam’s for 65 years. He remembers when the Nile used to flood his irrigation canals every year with clear, nutrient-rich water. “I used to drink from the Nile right here. And I never ever got sick,” Mahmoud says.</p>
<p>For centuries, farmers relied solely on the Nile to water their cropland, digging a complex network of irrigation canals to connect the entire delta region to the river and its tributaries. But as Egypt’s population has soared, so has its water consumption; and as factories, power plants and megacities have emerged along the Nile’s banks, the clear, rich water of Mahmoud’s youth has been fouled by all manner of human, chemical and industrial waste. Nowadays, by the time the Nile reaches Salam and Mahmoud’s fields, it has been reduced to a brown, toxic trickle.</p>
<p>To compensate, the farmers in the area have dug a well. Salam and Mahmoud, along with about a dozen of their neighbors, take turns running a fuel-powered pump to flood their respective irrigation canals with water from the <a href="https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mXCqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;dq=nile+delta+aquifer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CNUqnxVmFP&amp;sig=fo96poV9yBUodDFZBBUGOBJwKC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI2uuoy6WDyQIVzLIUCh3vAQ8N#v=onepage&amp;q=nile%20delta%20aquifer&amp;f=false">Nile Delta aquifer</a>, a massive underground reservoir, spanning from Cairo to the Mediterranean Sea.  On the surface, this seems like a good solution to the delta’s water shortage problem, but this sort of pumping is accelerating the region’s demise, according to Badr Mabrouk, a hydrology professor at Zagazig University. “When you draw the water up from the deep aquifers, it creates pressure and it draws the sea in,” Mabrouk said.</p>
<p>Rising sea levels had already put the Nile Delta aquifer in peril before farmers began deep-well pumping, Mabrouk explained, but they have made it worse. The way coastal aquifers work is that they meet and hold back the sea underground at a point called the transition zone: The higher density saltwater sinks and gets pulled back toward the ocean and the freshwater remains on top. As long as sea levels—and aquifer levels—remain stable, this meeting point doesn’t move.</p>
<p>But if either the sea rises or the fresh water recedes, this point moves farther inland: The sea advances underground. In the case of the Nile Delta, both are happening and they’re happening quickly, Mabrouk said. As the ocean warms and its waters expand, sea levels in Egypt are rising, and the land is sinking at a rate of 0.1 inches per year as a result, according to the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa Program</a>. Meanwhile, excessive pumping is draining the aquifer faster than rainfall can refill it.</p>

<p>Climate scientists and geologists have been warning of the danger of saltwater intrusion in Egypt’s Delta for decades. But in a country riven with political upheaval and economic insecurity, the environment has never been the government’s priority—and still isn’t, according to Hassan Husseiny, a water management specialist for the American University in Cairo’s <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Sustainability/Rise/Pages/Home.aspx">Research Institute for Sustainable Environment</a>. “Studies say climate change could begin to have a real effect after 20 years,” Husseiny says. “The government doesn’t look that far ahead.”</p>
<p>But up in the northern Delta region, sea-level rise is no longer a matter of looking ahead: On a daily basis, the sea is pounding away at the populous cities of Alexandria, Damietta and Port Said. If the sea rises by even 20 inches (which <a href="http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise">a 2014 National Climate Assessment</a> projects will likely occur by 2100) <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">30 percent of Alexandria</a>, a city of 5 million, will be inundated.</p>
<p>In the popular coastal resort town of Baltim, about 30 miles north of Kafr el-Sheikh, mango farmer Mossad Abu Ghali has seen the sea advancing. “I remember when they had to build a new boardwalk because the old one got ruined by the sea,” Abu Ghali says. “That was a long time ago though. Inshallah, the sea is not advancing anymore.” Baltim built a seawall in 1992 out of large, concrete tetrapod blocks. This has slowed—but not stopped—the sea’s advance. This type of structure, known as a <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/statclim/whatcanbedone.html">revetment</a>, has an average life span of 30 to 50 years. Already the wall is half-buried in sand.</p>
<p>All along the coast, cities and towns like Baltim have constructed sea walls to try and hold back the water, but even with these measures in place, Husseiny predicted that no fewer than 10 million people would be displaced in the next 30 years.</p>
<h2><strong>The Delta’s eleventh hour</strong></h2>
<p>In 1972, Egypt launched the Coastal Research Institute (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Coastal-Research-Institute-Cori-436770736371496/info/?tab=overview">CORI</a>) to “monitor and protect” the Egyptian coast, but to date, its work has focused far more on monitoring than protecting. “There has yet to be any action taken in the delta that I know of,” Husseiny said. “There have been conferences and meetings and discussions but no action.”</p>
<p>The institute’s current flagship program is a joint venture started in 2009 with the United Nations Development Program and Global Environment Facility. The project is to create “<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/dam/egypt/docs/Environment%20and%20Energy/Climate%20Change%20Project%20Document.pdf">integrated coastal zone management systems</a>” on Egypt’s coasts by building sea barriers out of natural materials. Six years and <a href="http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/sccf-czm-egypt">$4 million later</a>, they have managed to “select a pilot site,” design an “adaptation technique” and solicit bids from contractors to work on a pilot site—but have <a href="http://www.eg.undp.org/content/egypt/en/home/operations/projects/environment_and_energy/project_sample.html">yet to build</a> a single sea barrier.</p>
<p>Aymen el-Gamal, CORI’s deputy director, works out of an office less than half a mile from the sea, and he doesn’t deny the sea levels are rising. But, he says, there is little use in trying to predict the rate at which it will rise—and there’s no sense in planning more  than one or two years ahead. Most existing models are just alarmist and unhelpful, el-Gamal says. He’s also unconvinced human-induced climate change is real. “The Earth is very clever. It can take in energy and emit it,” el-Gamal says. “There are those who say there is the greenhouse effect and the ozone—no, the Earth is bigger than all of this.” His smile is confident and kind. “So the climate change from my point of view is a normal phenomenon.” Which is why he sees his role as one of simply monitoring sea-level rise and adapting to the data as it comes in.</p>
<p>For farmers like Salam, Mahmoud and Abu Ghali, however, that won’t work. The hour is late for the delta. “The land is slowly, slowly running out of time,” Mabrouk said. Egypt’s primary food source is sinking into the sea while its government—and the international community—watches on.</p>

<p>Global leaders are gearing up for the landmark COP21 climate change summit in Paris, where they are hoping to reach consensus on a new set of regulations for greenhouse gas emissions to replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2020. But even the most aggressive of global reforms won’t do a thing to save Egypt’s Nile Delta. Even if global leaders succeed in their goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (an ambitious goal to begin with), the seas are expected to continue rising for decades to come, according to a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/071615-international-report-confirms-2014-was-earths-warmest-year-on-record.html">report</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.</p>
<p>Land loss and damage from climate change are on the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/session/9057.php">agenda</a> for the summit, but it’s unlikely that Egypt’s case will be discussed specifically. Ultimately, the United Nations Framework for Climate Change has left it to individual countries to develop their own <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/workstreams/national_adaptation_plans/items/6057.php">National Adaptation Plans</a>. Egypt’s prime minister formed a <a href="http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/07/17/egypt-to-form-national-climate-change-council/">National Committee on Climate Change</a> in July to draft an up-to-date national strategy for combatting the problem, but a copy of this strategy has not been made public (if indeed it has been fully drafted).</p>
<p>In the meantime, there has been little if any international pressure on Egypt to update its national strategy expediently. All international critiques of Egypt tend to focus on the country’s national security problems, human rights abuses and poor democratic governance. As long as climate change remains a second-tier issue for the international community, the Egyptian state—and its people—will also regard it as one.</p>
<p>Even Abu Ghali, whose mango trees could be floating in saltwater within his lifetime, believes tackling climate change should come second to tightening security and restoring the economy. He has full confidence his president will help him in due time. “The government is under a lot of pressure,” Abu Ghali says. “We can’t expect everything to come all at once. [President Abdel-Fattah ] el-Sissi needs to first give jobs to people who need them. Later, he will help us.” Inshallah.</p>
