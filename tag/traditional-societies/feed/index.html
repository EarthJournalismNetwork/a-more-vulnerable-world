								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the hills of Mariashoni in the eastern part of Kenya’s Mau Forest Complex, sits an old indigenous <em>Yemdit</em> tree with pale orange-green leaves.</p>
<p>A lone ranger, the tree is surrounded by fresh green commercial eucalyptus trees. A single log beehive – a traditional form of beekeeping to the region’s native population – sits firmly attached to its moss green branches.</p>
<p>This forest – almost unrecognizable – is home to Joseph Chemaina, who was born into Kenya’s indigenous Ogiek community in 1958, when the forest was thick with indigenous trees.</p>
<p>While their numbers back then were closer to 200, the Ogiek population within the Mariashoni area has jumped to approximately 1,700 people of voting age – which is 18 in Kenya – but remains only a minute representation of the estimated 15,000 adult Ogieks living in the Mau Forest Complex and 20,000 across Kenya. Because of the limited data on Ogiek families, these numbers are misleading. With an estimated average family size of ten people, the forest’s Ogiek population could actually be closer to 150,000 people.</p>
<p>“I was born in the forest and when I opened my eyes, all I saw was a forest. A thick forest; every inch you moved, a shrub or tree squeezed your shoulders,” said the 57-year-old Chemaina.</p>
<div id="attachment_186" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186" class="size-large wp-image-186" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg" alt="A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/The-log-beehive-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-186" class="wp-caption-text">A log beehive sits in the branches of an indigenous Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Each family had its own territory surrounded with a canopy of trees stretching up to 100 meters high.</p>
<p>Here, high atop these branches, the Ogieks would affix log beehives, the backbone of their simple economy. Honey gathered from these hives provided a reliable source of food, income and medicine.</p>
<p>“Honey was in plenty, one Ogiek could have up to 800 beehives,” said Chemaina.</p>
<p>Bees collected nectar and pollen from the indigenous trees, which flowered in different seasons of the year due to regular rainfall and flowing streams.</p>
<p>Back then, the forest provided an abundant source of food and water for the community and Chemaina said he could pick a variety of wild fruits and hunt for rabbits under its dewy cover. Experience had taught the Ogiek to expect brief rains from February to April before the onset of heavier rainfall during the second half of the year. Never, said Chemaina, did it disappoint them.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the flowering season stretched from November to March and the honey harvest yielded ample returns.</p>
<p>“Each beehive produced more than 100 kilogrammes of honey,” he explained.</p>
<p>The Ogieks consider nectar and pollen from the indigenous <em>Tongotwet</em> and <em>Kureyet</em> trees to be very special, and used the dark brown honey as a remedy for chest, stomach, nerve and bone problems.</p>
<p>It was also used as a cure for injuries and fever in children. Expectant mothers drank the thick, dark substance like milk and it served as a disinfectant and wound sanitizer during delivery.</p>
<p>“We survived without the worry of diseases because honey was a powerful dose of medicine,” Chemaina said. But the once rich supply of these indigenous trees began to diminish after illegal logging, charcoal burning and other human activities caused extensive destruction of the forest. Rainfall patterns became less predictable and many local flowering plants started to disappear.</p>
<div id="attachment_190" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree..jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190" class="size-large wp-image-190" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg" alt="Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joseph-Chemaina-showing-the-logbeehive-affixed-on-the-indigenous-Yemdit-tree.-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-190" class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Chemaina shows off a log beehive high atop a Yemdit tree (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Medicinal honey is now a rarity that the Ogieks are forced to accept.</p>
<p>Chemaina now counts only 37 beehives on his 30-acre territory, compared to some 700 he had until early 1990s. “Bee keeping is my life and the life of Ogieks,” he said. “I want to have that life of dense forest back. I want a reverse of the weather patterns – to have the rains as normal.”</p>
<p>But harvesting has been reduced to once in a year and on many occasions, Chemaina has been forced to skip seasons due to lack of honey. Where he used to get 100 kilogrammes from each beehive, he now gets less than 10.</p>
<p>Despite these weather-related challenges, Chemaina said nothing will detach him from the traditional system of rearing bees. He said the demand for the special medicinal honey is even higher since cold weather ailments are affecting him and fellow community members.</p>
<p>“I still need it to help with my chest and fever. It has now become a common problem I have to deal with and hospitals were never part of our lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Augmenting these environmental stresses, the ruthless destruction of the forest over the last two decades has cost the forest community an abundance of wild rabbits, fruits and indigenous vegetation that is critical to their survival.</p>
<p>As early as 1990, people invaded the Mau forest to burn trees into charcoal, an activity that decimated the forest and drove away much of the bee population. By 2000, this damage had spread to more than 100,000 hectares of the forest.</p>
<p>According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), up to 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex’s 416,000 hectares were destroyed between 1990 and 2001.</p>
<p>Cosmas Ikiugu, head of Mau Conservancy in the Kenya Forest Service, said much of the eastern and western parts of the Mau Forest Complex were heavily degraded.</p>
<p>It’s here that more than 150,000 people – including Ogieks – have illegally settled, extending the destruction that the forestry agency admits is a challenge that requires a multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<div id="attachment_194" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-194" class="size-large wp-image-194" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg" alt="A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/An-overview-of-a-section-of-Mariashoni-in-the-Mau-Forest-Complex-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-194" class="wp-caption-text">A cleared section of Mariashoni in the Mau Forest Complex (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>High carbon emissions, soil erosion and decreased groundwater levels are only some of the byproducts of these damaging human activities.</p>
<p>“By 2008, the Mau River was actually drying up. Lake Nakuru which depends on the river was facing a major problem of low water levels,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Teresia Chemutai, a 53-year-old Ogiek woman, said the community relies on water from the Mau River during the dry period since there is no more water flowing freely under their feet.</p>
<p>Groundwater streams such as Segut, Ndoswa and Napuyapui are now extinct, she said.</p>
<p>Women, she said, never went out to hunt for wild meat, rear or harvest honey to feed their families during their days in the forest. But that has changed.</p>
<p>“There is too much work for Ogiek women nowadays. There have to walk long distances to get water, go out to look for food just as men. They bear the burden of ever sickly chicken and give birth to weak children,” she said.</p>
<p>Under bleak circumstances, the Ogiek have reluctantly moved to crop and livestock farming. But the chemical pesticides used to treat the crops is also threatening what’s left of their precious bees.</p>
<p>Chemutai said she started farming in 1997 after the government apportioned her and a few other Ogieks land in the forest. Non-Ogieks that they refer to as “invaders” also received land allocations and to date, the issue remains a grievance that the government has yet to address.</p>
<p>The Ogieks left without government-granted land started farming areas within the territories they originally inhabited.</p>
<p>Chemutai currently has three acres of maize and one of potatoes, but says the practice has been difficult to learn.</p>
<p>“I have been farming for years now, but I still feel I am not used to it,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_187" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187" class="size-large wp-image-187" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg" alt="Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Teresia-Chemutai-in-her-three-acre-piece-of-land-under-maize-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-187" class="wp-caption-text">Theresia Chemutai tends to her three acre maize field (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>And just like the trees and flowering plants that have slowly died off, their crops remain susceptible to changes in the weather patterns.</p>
<p>Dry spells threaten maize and potatoes – the main food staples now grown in this area. Many Ogieks still remember a devastating drought that struck the region in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>“We were shocked and worried over the happenings. The crops dried and very little was available for consumption,” said Joseph Barngetuny, a 56-year-old Ogiek farmer.</p>
<p>Recognizing these challenges to traditional ways of life, Kenya’s Ministry of Agriculture is educating members of the Ogiek community on the practice of modern beekeeping. “Traditional beehives are no longer productive due to the changed habitat,” said Phillip Owiti, an apiculture officer with the agricultural ministry. “The bee colonies have reduced as a result of unsuitable conditions for survival.”</p>
<p>So far, he said, they have trained 275 Ogieks from Mariashoni who have embraced modern beekeeping.</p>
<p>“We are making all efforts to help them (Ogieks) change their socio-cultural attachment to the environment because the climate change is not sparing their traditional way of keeping bees,” he said.</p>
<p>But results have been mixed. Joseph Barngetuny is one of the farmers who shifted to modern beekeeping. He currently occupies 30 acres of land in Mariashoni and has eight portable beehives, which unlike the traditional log beehives can be erected on sheds or other structures around a farm.</p>

<p>Each, he said, produces no more than 10 kilogrammes of honey, a low production he partly attributes to lost bee colonies, contaminated flowering plants and lack of adequate water sources.</p>
<p>Because of the inadequate harvest, he must continue to grow maize to meet the financial needs of his 20 children from two wives. Though he consumes the honey he produces, he said it has lost the ingredients that made it a special food for the community.</p>
<p>But even more troubling still, the Ogieks lack legal claim to the land they have worked so tirelessly to till. Though they say it’s their ancestral right, it’s a subject that’s rarely mentioned or talked in community circles.</p>
<p>Nahashon Kiptoo, a member of the Ogiek Council of Elders, compared the community’s lack of title deeds to an open wound awaiting a very strong antidote to heal.</p>
<p>“I have developed ulcers imagining us being displaced from here. We fear of other people acquiring title deeds for the parcels of land we are currently occupying. That will be disastrous to us,” said Kiptoo.</p>
<p>The acquisition of title deeds is just one of their pressing needs. The Ogieks also wish for a section of the forest to be officially declared as their secluded home.</p>
<p>Kiptoo said that since their lives begin and end in the forest, they should be allowed to live freely as they did before.</p>
<p>“We will be very happy to go back to [traditional ways of life in the forest]. We miss that life of jumping from one tree to another like monkeys,” said the elder. “We were very strong. We could fall from a 100 metre tree and never died.”</p>
<p>The Ogieks also want a fresh audit of their members to determine how many are in need of title deeds. Findings of a survey done in 2010 by the Interim Mau Restoration Coordinating Secretariat are yet to be made public.</p>
<div id="attachment_189" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189" class="wp-image-189 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on-1024x576.jpg" alt="Obiria - Nahashon Kiptoo shows the wild berries they fed on" width="760" height="428" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nahashon-Kiptoo-shows-the-wild-berries-they-fed-on-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-189" class="wp-caption-text">Nahashon Kiptoo shows off wild berries that are becoming a rarity (Credit: Moraa Obiria)</p></div>
<p>Joseph Towett, who participated in the survey, said the adult Ogiek population in Mau Forest Complex were originally approximated to be 11,000 people. But he puts the current figure closer to 15,000.</p>
<p>“That list is now outdated and several things have changed since then. We need title deeds, support to establish sustainable livelihoods since climate change has adversely affected our lives. We also need engagement in the conservation of Mau,” said Towett, who also chairs the Ogiek Council of Elders.</p>
<p>Ikiugu, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) official, said their concerns over land ownership and engagement in proactive conservation activities is something the government has and will continue to put effort to address.</p>
<p>“We realize that security over land gives them long-term control over the conservation activities in the area which eventually determines rate of climate change,” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>Ikiugu said they are encouraging the Ogieks to form Community Forest Associations through which they will legally access the benefits accrued from the forests including allocation of land in the forest for cultivation.</p>
<p>A piece of legislation passed in 2005 legalised a system of forest cultivation to forest adjacent communities. Known as the Plantation Establishment for Livelihoods Scheme (PELIS), it allows for community members to access and manage forest land. They are allowed to graze cows and plant crops on a designated plot of land for three years, as long as they also grow trees with certified seedlings provided by KFS. The seedlings are a mix of indigenous and exotic species, with limitations of what can be harvested for timber, but enforcement remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>So far, officials say that 70,000 hectares have been rehabilitated through concerted efforts between the state’s forestry agency and non-state actors, namely the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), among others.</p>
<p>Exotic species such as eucalyptus, cypress and pine have been introduced in 50,000 hectares while the rest has been restored with indigenous trees, Ikiugu said. He believes that high water levels at the Mau River swelling up Lake Nakuru and Mara River are outcomes of the intensive restoration activities at the water tower.</p>

<p>“There is an overflow of water into Lake Nakuru presently submerging houses belonging to the officials at (Lake Nakuru National Park),” said Ikiugu.</p>
<p>But Timothy Kiogora, the Nakuru county environmental director, said he remains concerned over the continued practice of the harmful human activities in the forest. Dealing with it requires commitment from all stakeholders, he said.</p>
<p>“It is one thing to tell people about the effects of destroying the forests and how to conserve it but it becomes another issue in converting the information into results,” said Kiogora.</p>
<p>“For people who depend on the forest, you must be able to give them the best alternative to be able to sustainably protect the forest against any destruction,” he added.</p>
<p>The county official said they have outlined effective strategies on educating communities living in the Mau Forest Complex on use of solar and other energy saving cooking stoves to save the forest.</p>
<p>While the government strives to rehabilitate the Mau Forest Complex and assist the Ogieks in adapting to changes in the climate, the community continues to hope that the bees will return.</p>
<p>“It tells a lot about the value of our environment,” said elder council member Kiptoo. “Only by recognising the value of indigenous trees and the ecosystem they enjoyed will we have again stocks of the honey.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Extreme weather events are destroying the silkworms that produce Assam’s famous golden silk</strong></p>
<p>Assam, in North-east India, produces one of the finest, and most expensive, types of silk in the world. Produced by the semi-domesticated silkworm <em>Antheraea assamensis,</em> which is only found in the Brahmaputra Valley, this silk is called <em>Muga</em> –  Assamese for “yellow” or “amber” –  and is often called golden silk. This silk has been produced in the region from as far back as 321 BC, and is an inextricable part of the life and culture of Assam. Unfortunately silkworms are highly sensitive to climatic conditions since they are grown outdoors. Recently unpredictable rainfall patterns, a rise in temperature and persistent floods have endangered <em>Muga</em> cocoon production across the state.</p>
<p>Due to the long history of sericulture, <em>Muga</em> silk occupies a special place in the lives of the indigenous people, inextricably linked to their cultural life. Moreover <em>Muga silk</em> is one of the most expensive silks in the world due its durability and beauty. The lustre of the fabric increases with each wash, making it a product that is treasured – and which lasts – throughout the lifetime of its owner. In 2007, Assam received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for <em>Muga</em> silk. A GI tag is given to products that are produced in a particular area, and boosts the reputation of the product.</p>

<p>There is a demand for more than 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of <em>Muga</em> silk annually, but the state has been producing an average 90 mt per year. In 2011-12 the production increased a little to 115 mt, according to sources from the Sericulture Department. However there are fears of negative or stagnant results in the next crop seasons. This year’s crop production was affected by rising temperature and floods.</p>
<h2><strong>A flood of troubles in Dhemaji</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhemaji_district">Dhemaji district</a> in northern Assam is a major <em>Muga</em> growing area. About 98% of the people of the district live in the rural areas and agriculture is the principal occupation for more than 85% of the people. These families are also engaged in <em>Muga</em> cultivation. <em>Muga</em> cultivation is a labour intensive activity and almost all the family members of the household are involved in silkworm rearing, silk reeling and weaving. Unfortunately for the farmers of Dhemaji floods are destroying the basis of this industry.</p>
<p>The district has experienced recurrent floods, on an annual basis for the last few years. The Dhemaji Agriculture Department put the number of farm families affected this year at 50,500. Assam has an average <a href="http://www.jsk.gov.in/dlhs3/assam.pdf">family size of just under 5 people per family</a>, which would mean that almost 250,000 people would have been affected out of a total population of <a href="http://www.census2011.co.in/census/district/147-dhemaji.html">about 700,000.</a> A total of 3,718 hectares of agricultural land was covered in silt this year, pushing the affected people to search alternative livelihood in non-agricultural sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_41" style="width: 1030px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" class="size-full wp-image-41" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg" alt="The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)" width="1020" height="633" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-41" class="wp-caption-text">The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)</p></div>
<p>The floods and siltation have destroyed, or endangered, plantations of the Som plant, on which the <em>Muga</em> silkworms feed. The Som plantations – known as <em>Sumonis</em> – have been gradually destroyed as they have either been displaced, or their roots buried in sandy silt. Kusha Sonowal of Laomuri village, Dhemaji, said that the unavailability of good quality seeds has severely affected indigenous <em>Muga</em> rearing. Abandoning her expertise in weaving, she now helps her family run a small tea stall some 2 kilometres from her home.</p>
<h2><strong>Loss linked to change in temperature and humidity</strong></h2>
<p>Joya Duvarah, who now runs a small shop near the main road in Laomuri village, laments that her family would have earned millions if only their once prosperous <em>Muga</em> cultivation thrived. The chronic havoc of flood brought disaster and they had to cut down hectares of their Som plantations that had rotted after being submerged for months. “Apart from floods that have eaten away our <em>Sumonis</em>, a rise in temperature has brought down the production. The silkworms that are grown outside cannot bear so much heat. Vagaries of weather are responsible for premature death of worms.” she added.</p>
<p>The silkworm needs temperatures of around 30-35 degree Celsius and a humidity level of 80-85% in order to thrive. Dhemaji suffered heavy losses in <em>Muga</em> production in the last couple of years as silkworms died out due to the increase of air temperature and humidity, according to the Sericulture Department of Assam.  The current records show the annual rainfall of the district ranges from 2600 mm to 3200 mm, the relative humidity varies from 90% to 73% while the temperature varies between 39.9C in summer and 5.9C in winter. Changes in temperature and humidity lead to diseases like <a href="http://www.thethirdpole.net/2015/beth.walker/Downloads/Flacherie,%20and%20Grasserie">Flacherie</a>, and Grasserie that can wipe out an entire lot of silkworms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tocklai.net/">Tocklai Experimental Station</a>, the premier body in tea research in the state and the oldest tea research station in the world, has observed that in the last 90 there has been a <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090328/jsp/northeast/story_10728043.jsp">rise in temperature of 1.5C in many areas, and that the rainfall has decreased by 200mm on average</a>, and is now down to <a href="http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/urban/rainfall.htm">2,800mm a year</a>. Climate change compels tea cultivators to use more pesticides to kill pests and mites in their garden. This pesticide contaminates the air, and silkworms die when they breathe in the pesticides used in tea gardens nearby.</p>
<p>Though climate change has been affecting silkworms in Assam, there is no research or planning to save the glorious silk of Assam. Sources at the zonal office of the Central Silk Board in, Guwahati, the state capital, say that the board has not initiated any study on the impacts of climate change on <em>Muga</em> silk production.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixty two-year-old Luciano Mangaeao of Paranora in Beira, Mozambique could not hide his fear.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his hand on a sweltering afternoon and remarked dejectedly: “It’s almost rain season and I know what it means for us. It means a season of suffering; floods and storms are coming again.”</p>
<p>Though he has lived with his family in Paranora on the coast of the Indian Ocean for over three decades, the extreme weather events experienced in Beira over the past decade have left him and other residents at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>Beira, a colonial city that sprouted in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, was originally designed to accommodate 30,000 people, but today it is Mozambique’s second largest city with a population of more than 500,000. The city is a critical gateway to the sea for landlocked countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, but many of the residents live in abject poverty.</p>
<p>Experts say that tropical cyclones build up over the Indian Ocean and send water surging into Beira, inundating residential and poverty-stricken areas, many of which are below sea level. Within hours, the drainage system backs up, evacuation routes are cut off, and fecal material seeps into the fields and the food chain, even contaminating drinking water.</p>
<p>Figures from the Mozambican government reveal that between 1980 and 1993, two category three or higher cyclones hit the country, compared to seven in the period between 1994 and 2007.According to a 2013 report,<em>Assessing the Risk of Cyclone-Induced Storm Surge and Sea-level Rise in Mozambique</em>, wind risks in Beira are much higher than in the capital, Maputo. Maputo is more effectively shielded by the Madagascar land-mass, which also tends to dissipate cyclone energy, so the probability of intense wind events is much higher in Beira.</p>
<div id="attachment_267" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267" class="size-large wp-image-267" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A house in Beira that was destroyed by a tropical cyclone (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-267" class="wp-caption-text">A house in Beira that was destroyed by a tropical cyclone (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>“During the rainy season some parts of Beira experience massive flooding and we are forced to abandon our homes and move to higher areas inland. We lose property worth thousands of dollars each season but because our lives depend on the sea we have no choice but to return after the floods,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>Some buildings have been abandoned for good and are left to slowly crumble. A deserted government building stands close to the sea, so are many others including shops and beer halls. Roads have been also been destroyed.</p>
<p>The crudely built stone, sack and sand sea walls tell a story of poverty as Beira struggles to adapt to climate change-induced calamities. Some of the sea barricades have succumbed to tropical cyclones and storms. Other parts of the barricades are slowly receding into the rising sea water.</p>
<p>The extreme weather events in Beira are beyond the comprehension of many, with some residents convinced that the apocalyptic end is nigh.</p>
<p>“No one is telling us what is happening but from the stories we hear on television the future does not look good for us,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>His fears were shared by Luiza Ferenando, an illiterate middle aged woman who lives in Storire, a neighborhood in the city.</p>
<p>“My life depends on fishing and I can’t leave this place. I have no other opportunities outside this area,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" class="size-large wp-image-266" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg" alt="Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-266" class="wp-caption-text">Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Thirty four-year-old Eduardo Fuinouto has been living in Paranora for sixteen years, selling different wares to the fishermen in Beira.</p>
<p>“When storms come our businesses come to a halt and we move to higher grounds. But our future is here and we hope our mayor will do something to serve our city and our businesses,” Fuinouto said.</p>
<p>Faustino Estacha, a twenty three-year-old university student, also remains optimistic that the mayor of Beirahas bigger plans to save the city.</p>
<p>“One of these plans is to build a sea wall which can save our homes,” he said.</p>
<p>He added: “People have nice homes and they can’t just leave but the barricades which used to be here have been destroyed by the sea water.”</p>
<p>According to Bill McKibben, a U.S.-based climate activist and founder of <em>350.org</em>, some communities facing rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions have no choice but to leave for good.</p>
<p>“Building sea walls is an option, but very expensive. The frustration is that the world seems not care. It’s a very depressing situation and some people (living on coastal areas) have to pack their bags and go,” McKibben said.</p>
<p>In the face of this growing threat, Graca Machel, a human rights activist and member of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders who work together for peace and human rights,urges coastal countries to develop programs to better assist these vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>“Countries on coastal areas should come up with policies on how to protect communities or encourage the people to move a little further from the coast,” Machel said.</p>
<p>The mayor of Beira, Daviz Simango, said more than 100,000 residents living in low lying areas in the city will have to be relocated to higher areas in the next decade.</p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-large wp-image-265" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>He was quick to add that the city needed more than US$100 million to address climate change-induced problems, an amount that he said the city could not raise without the intervention of the private sector.</p>
<p>A Dutch engineering firm, Deltares, is working with other private companies like Witteveen +Bos, Wissing, Niras Mozambique and VandenBroek Consulting to partner with the city of Beira to develop a so-called <em>Beira Master Plan 2035 </em>and avert a full-on climate change disaster.</p>
<p>“Two important initiatives in this respect are: capacity building and institutional strengthening focused on the planning and enforcement capacity of municipality and the establishment of the Beira Land Development Company,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Simango said the Land Development Company, which will be a partnership between the city and private investors, will assist in the implementation of a new finance model where financial feasibility of the Beira Municipality and of the masterplan is increased through several business cases.</p>
<p>“The selling of dredging sand and the selling of land with road and drainage infrastructure are important income generating elements of this finance model,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Deltares senior project manager Peter Letitre said they would establish a land development company through an initial investment of up to US$20 million.</p>
<p>“A reasonable starting budget would be around US$10- $20 million. Planning capacity and financial means need to be mobilized. Besides, a better (win-win) cooperation between City and Port of Beira is very important for the economic growth of the Port and the City”.</p>
<p>According to this ambitious plan, the city needs to stop uncontrolled issuing of land to developers especially in areas which should be designated for water retention.</p>
<p>There is also a need to plan, zone and enforce land reserved for important future infrastructure projects like retention basins, drainage canals, sewage lines and roads. Assessments of the potential vulnerabilities of vital infrastructure – such as power lines, roads and railways – to flooding, and repairs of these weaknesses must also be conducted.</p>
<p>But significant obstacles to the implementation of such plans remain.</p>
<p>Land regulations in Beira are poorly enforced, which contributes to fragmented urban development. Here, speculators purchase property at low prices with the hope of later turning a profit, and are not willing to give it to the government for infrastructure projects. Because there is no incentive for these private developers to work alongside government plans, sustainable development in Beira remains just out of reach.</p>
<div id="attachment_269" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-269" class="size-large wp-image-269" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg" alt="Communities along Beira's vulnerable coastline (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Some-of-the-communities-on-the-shore-in-Beira1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-269" class="wp-caption-text">Communities along Beira&#8217;s vulnerable coastline (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Letitre said the government must play a critical role in designating and enforcing reserved spaces for important future projects.</p>
<p>“This is a complex process for which cooperation of the inhabitants is very important. Ordinary people (in Beira) are also involved in planning of various projects such as the drainage projects in various neighborhoods, in cooperation with the authorities. They are also involved in operation and maintenance of drainage projects and solid waste projects,” Letitre said.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, Letitre remains bullish on Beira’s future. “After the master plan is successfully implemented,” he said, “Beira will be a safer, more sustainable, prosperous and beautiful city.”</p>
<p>These are hopeful words, but one thing is certain: successful implementation of the Beira Master Plan will require the participation of key stakeholders in the city or risk facing the same fate as similar plans that have come before it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mebai Warusam sits under his stilt-supported house, facing the Pacific Ocean’s turquoise waters lapping 50 metres from his front gate. At 91, born and raised on the island of Saibai in the <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/torres-strait-islands">Torres Strait</a>, he is an elder visitors and locals turn to for knowledge.</p>
<p>A few years ago, he says, researchers from down south travelled to Saibai. “They said, ‘If water comes right through this island, what you will do?’ I said, ‘I will never move from this island.’” “I will jump on my boat, tie that rope on a wongai tree. I will live here; I will die here.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1YvT1crPEf4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Patimah Waia, a teacher, underlines the point. “People are now realising that global warming [is happening] and water is rising and Saibai is low … some people, even though they realise its global warming that causes the water to rise, are so much in love with the place that they don’t want to leave.”</p>
<p>Saibai is one of more than 200 islands and coral cays that make up the Torres Strait, the archipelago straddling the waters between the northernmost tip of mainland Australia and <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/papua-new-guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. Eighteen of the strait’s islands are inhabited. For most of the island communities here, the impact of climate change is a daily reality. Coastal erosion, rising sea levels, worsening yearly floods, frightening king tides and drought are all regular occurrences.</p>
<p><a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/what-paris-climate-negotiators-are-up-against-and-what-it-means-for-australia">As Australia negotiates new global climate targets with the world’s decision-makers in Paris</a>, many in the Torres Strait hope for increased attention to the culturally and environmentally unique islands slowly sinking in Australia’s backyard. Saibai and the rest of the Torres Strait islands are officially part of Queensland.</p>

<p><a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.tsra.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2005/Current-and-Future-Climates-of-the-Torres-Strait-web.pdf">A climate report</a> published by the Torres Strait regional authority, the local Indigenous body, found sea levels in the region rose by 6mm each year from 1993 to 2010, compared with a global average of 3.22mm. The same report said the mean rate of sea level rise since the middle of the 19th century has been higher than the mean rate in the previous two millennia. For the seafaring Torres Strait islanders, the rise can mean profound lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>“Our word for home is the same as an island,” says Joseph Elu, chairman of the Torres Strait regional authority. “If that is lost, people will have nothing left. The weather patterns have changed. We usually get storms this time of the year but we haven’t had one yet.”</p>
<p>When the storms do come, so do the tides. For low-lying islands such as Saibai and Boigu in the far north of the strait, this means annual floods and inundation.</p>
<p>People here are no strangers to unexpected weather events. In the years after the second world war, a water spout inundated Saibai, drowning crops and filling wells with salt water. Fearing a repeat, in 1947 several families from the island relocated to Cape York on the Australian mainland and established villages, known today as Bamaga and Seisia.</p>
<p>Elu says his family was among those who left Saibai. Now extreme weather has become commonplace, he says. “What happened there on the one instance that water spout came down is now happening twice or three times a year in the full moon high tide months of December, January and February.”</p>

<p>Normally, rain mitigates the impact of seawater inundation by washing the soil of salt, enabling crops to grow. But this year the drought that has also hit much of <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> has brought water restrictions to including Saibai and Boigu – and fears for what might happen if it doesn’t rain soon.</p>
<p>The demand for resources on Saibai, particularly fresh water, is heightened by pressure from the coastal villages in adjacent Papua New Guinea, says John Rainbird, a climate specialist at the Torres Strait regional authority.</p>
<p>Under a treaty, communities from the two countries trade and interact with each other daily. Now the villages in Papua New Guinea have run low on water and villagers regularly come over to Saibai seeking basic services.</p>
<p>For community leaders such as Keri Akiba, the increased pressure stokes fears. “I’m really worried. Sometimes I’m sitting, just thinking that in 20 to 50 years all this place will be under water, the way it’s going,” he says. “It will be under the water most of the time, and then the sicknesses and diseases that will obviously come out of that.”</p>

<p>Rainbird was one of the architects of the Torres Strait’s climate strategy. The focus is on planning and resilience. Of course, planning is made harder by the fact nobody knows for sure just how fast the changes will happen. But one thing is sure, he says. “Anywhere that you have a problem, climate change will only make that problem worse.”</p>
<p>The Torres Strait, says Rainbird, is on the front line of climate change in Australia. Now is the time to prepare. “In 30 years’ time, the Gold Coast, Sydney and Melbourne will all be dealing with sea level impact in some way, competing for limited government resources,” Rainbird says. “We need to get in early while we can.”</p>
<p>The Torres Strait’s population pales in comparison with the coastal areas in Australia’s south. Government statistics show about 8,700 people live in the Torres Strait, while more than 40,000 Torres Strait islanders live in other parts of Australia. Initially climate change will affect only a few hundred islanders, in particular on the low-lying islands of Saibai, Boigu, Masig, Warraber and Iama.</p>

<p>Do Torres Strait islanders feel they have been forgotten? Elu smiles at the question, pointing out there is a book calling the Torres Strait islands the “forgotten isles”. Elu says the previous government dedicated funds to helping <a class=" u-underline" href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/vanishing-homeland-leaves-people-with-nowhere-to-go-20130211-2e8tz.html">Pacific island nations such as Kiribati</a> deal with the threat of rising sea levels, as Torres Strait islanders looked on. “Islands are sinking here,” he says.</p>
<p>Within the Torres Strait, some feel they’ve been left to fend for themselves. Explaining the impact of sea level rise on Poruma Island, councillor Phillemon Mosby says despite media and government interest, little has been done to tackle the changes. “Does anybody out there know about us, does anybody care?”</p>
<p>On the central coral cay islands of which Poruma is one, the issue is erosion rather than of salt water inundation. Large chunks of the island get swept away by tides. In some cases, the sand migrates elsewhere on the island and builds new plateaus.</p>
<p>In remote areas, climate adaptation and building resilient communities is expensive, and although Indigenous people have traditional ways of recording and adapting to changes in weather, the competition for limited funds is fierce. Although $26m has been set aside for building seawalls on Saibai, it is estimated that will barely cover more than half the front part of the island. On mud islands such as Saibai, water also comes in from the wetlands in the middle and the back, leaving the islanders with a narrow strip of land between the ocean and the swamp.</p>
<div id="attachment_576" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Huusko_TorresStrait_November_2015-8.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-576" class="size-large wp-image-576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Huusko_TorresStrait_November_2015-8-1024x683.jpg" alt="The community has built seawalls here to keep the sea at bay during the rainy season.

(Credit: Saila Huusko)</p></div>
<p>Many locals also recognise that putting up seawalls is only a temporary solution. “You don’t want to scare the hell out of people but it’s also important that people are informed,” says Rainbird.</p>
<p>Mosby says: “When we hear warnings of tsunami and all that, people do get stressed about it. Mentally it is affecting our people.”</p>
<p>Being informed also means discussing the worst-case scenarios, including leaving the islands. But Saibai leader Keri Akiba says leaving is not an option his community is willing to consider. Leaving the island behind would mean abandoning culture, heritage and relatives buried here.</p>
<p>Akiba adds: “I hope the perpetrator governments that have got the coal power houses would decrease them so that the low-lying areas, the islands like Saibai, or even in the Pacific that we’ve seen in the news, get a little bit more time to enjoy their heritage and where they were born.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The amount of water is incomprehensible. We’ve been flying for hours, and just when we’re about as far from a landmass as you can possibly get—a spot where the curving, wave-flecked Pacific Ocean stretches thousands of kilometers in every direction—an island slides into view. It’s no more than a snippet of sand and palm trees, a snake winding through the blue plain of the Pacific. Fanning out around it are 1,200 similar islands, some inhabited, others not, arranged into a constellation of 29 atolls like stars in a universe of ocean. For every square kilometer of land in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, there are 10,732 square kilometers of ocean.</p>
<p>Roughly 2,000 years ago, voyagers sailing outrigger canoes discovered these smudges of land, and their descendants stayed, becoming the best navigators in the Pacific. While other cultures relied largely on the stars to find their way, Marshallese supplemented their astrological knowledge with an intricate understanding of wave dynamics and ocean currents. Boys floated on their backs for hours, memorizing the patterns beneath them. Later, far from home, they determined their location simply by the motion of the waves.</p>

<p>Even on land, Marshallese life is defined by the ocean. Since few plants grow in the sandy soil, the majority of food is harvested offshore; Marshallese contains 50 different words and phrases for fishing techniques. The foods that do come from land—breadfruit, taro, the fruit of the spiky pandanus plant—are often fermented or preserved for seafaring journeys. Even the language is born of the sea: instead of using “right” and “left” to give directions on land, the islanders use “ocean-side” (the outer edge of the atoll) and “lagoon-side” (the protected interior).</p>
<p>For generations, Marshallese called their home Aelõñ Kein Ad—“these islands of ours.” A few ships passed by, but the islands’ culture evolved in relative isolation until 1857, when the first wave of outsiders arrived: Christian missionaries bearing clothing, disease, and religion.</p>
<p>By the Second World War, Japan had taken over the islands to use as a strategic base. The outer islands were bombed by Allied forces for 75 days. Blood seeped into the sand. And when the war was over and the islands ceded to US control, nuclear testing began. Between 1946 and 1958, the United States detonated 67 atomic bombs on the Marshall Islands—the equivalent power of 1.6 Hiroshimas a day for 12 years straight. Islands were permanently despoiled and entire communities forced into exile on other, less livable, islands. Cancer rates increased, and miscarriages and previously unknown birth defects became common.</p>
<p>Through all of this, Marshallese culture adapted and survived. But today, it’s facing the one battle that might be impossible to win. Climate experts predict that because of rising sea levels caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the Marshall Islands could be uninhabitable by the end of this century.</p>
<p>As the ocean seeps into homes and buckles roads, it’s shifting from a source of inspiration to one of fear. Some Marshallese have already started to plan for relocation. Yet unlike other climate refugees—people from the island nation of Kiribati buying backup land in Fiji, for example, or the family from Tuvalu seeking climate refugee status in New Zealand—the Marshallese know exactly where they’ll go. An agreement that came into force when the Marshall Islands gained independence in 1986 allows any citizen to live and work in the United States indefinitely, without a visa or green card.</p>

<p>By the year 2100, it’s conceivable that climate change will force the entire population of the Marshall Islands to US shores. Already, more than 25,000 Marshallese—over a third of the population—have left the islands, many in the last 15 years. Among them was Sarah Joseph, now 22 and a resident of Enid, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Like Sarah, a surprising number of Marshallese migrants wind up landlocked in rural America, far from the ocean that’s shaped every aspect of their culture. Which raises the question: can Marshallese traditions and language survive without the sea? Or, in the words of the Marshallese minister of foreign affairs Tony deBrum, will climate change amount to cultural genocide?</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2006, I arrived on the remote Marshallese atoll of Ebon to teach English for a year. Sarah was the oldest daughter of the family I lived with, and one of my eighth grade students. She was smart and spunky, with a wide grin and dark hair in a floppy bun atop her head.</p>
<p>There’s no telephone or electricity on Ebon, and only one store offering rice, flour, Kool-Aid, and Spam. But sometimes, when even the one road running the length of the island began to feel too crowded, Sarah would take a boat across the 100-square-kilometer lagoon to a tiny island called Demdol, where her grandfather lived alone in a one-room shack. She’d stay for weeks, on a patch of sand no bigger than a football field, reading a Marshallese Bible, scrubbing laundry on a washboard, and collecting eggs from the chickens that pecked beneath the palms.</p>
<p>When I first met Sarah, she had just returned from Demdol. It was late August, and the days were unbearably hot. But evenings—when the sun slipped over the edge of the lagoon and the breeze rustled the palms and a string of coconut-shell fires glowed like jewels along a ribbon of land—evenings were everything I imagined living on a Pacific island would be. Sometimes Sarah would lounge in the hammock behind her parents’ house, strumming a beat-up ukulele and watching as the darkening lagoon mirrored the star-choked sky until the difference between the two became indistinguishable. It was as if we were sitting in a bowl of stars. As her mother, Rakki, stoked the fire, Sarah’s father, Jola—having spent the day cracking coconuts, drying the meat in the sun, and packing it into burlap sacks to sell for just a few dimes per kilogram—would slide his wooden skiff into the lagoon to fish.</p>
<p>Most nights, we’d already be asleep by the time Jola returned with the next day’s protein. But occasionally, if a child in the village was turning one, Sarah, Rakki, and I would join a handful of other women and walk by moonlight to the mother’s hut to sing to the child.</p>
<p>In the Marshall Islands, a first birthday is a significant milestone, and its celebration—which is much bigger than a wedding or funeral—is a remnant of the time when infant mortality was high.</p>
<p>The event begins at midnight, with a chorus of women singing to the child, and concludes days later with a traditional feast attended by the whole village. On outer islands like Ebon, the food is often served in baskets woven from palm fronds, piled with fried donuts, balls of rice, sea turtle, fish, pork, taro, breadfruit, pandanus, and more. Instead of bringing a gift, attendees take something from the host family—a pair of sandals, perhaps, or a frypan—and carry it home. The less the host family is left with, the greater their generosity. It’s a testament to the strength of the Marshallese community, an understanding that no matter how little you have, you’ll be cared for.</p>
<p>This was the world Sarah lived in for the first 14 years of her life. Looking back, it was paradise.</p>
<div id="attachment_146" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA031180.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146" class="size-large wp-image-146" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA031180-1024x768.jpg" alt="Sarah Joseph’s younger brother, Josa, plays in shallow water in the Marshall Islands where he lives.

(Credit: Krista Langlois)</p></div>
<p>But opportunities on Ebon are few, and the school only goes to eighth grade. Students from outer islands who pass a national exam and want to go to high school have to leave home, often staying in dormitories or with relatives in Majuro, the islands’ capital. Many never return. From 2006 to 2011, 17 of 26 outer islands experienced dramatic population loss, while Majuro’s population increased by 1,770, to about 28,000.</p>
<p>Yet although Majuro offers education and jobs not available on outer islands, life there presents its own set of challenges. The reefs have been overfished or damaged by development—Majuro residents eat an average of 71.5 kilograms of fish per year, compared to 147 kilograms on the outer islands. Processed, imported foods make up the difference, but they cost money, and there isn’t enough paid work to go around. On any given afternoon, countless young men lean against buildings or lie on cool cement floors, smoking cigarettes and passing time. Each year, hundreds of Marshallese leave the outer islands for Majuro, and, each year, hundreds more leave Majuro for the United States.</p>
<p>Sarah was among the few who would have been content to stay on Ebon. She dislikes cities and crowds of people. She likes swimming in the translucent turquoise lagoon and singing on Sundays at the little blue-and-white Protestant church on the edge of the sea. But Rakki and Jola wanted more for her. By the time Sarah graduated from eighth grade, seven out of Rakki’s nine siblings lived in the Unites States. One day, the family got word that a sister would buy Sarah a one-way ticket to “Amedka.”</p>
<p>It was late spring, 2008. Sarah sat at the edge of Ebon’s narrow landing strip, wedged between the lagoon and the ocean. She watched for the white speck of an airplane to materialize in the blinding blue sky. She tried not to cry.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like most Marshallese in the United States, Sarah didn’t move because of climate change. She moved because of a lack of opportunities, and because her family said it was best. Back then, in 2008, climate change was still a phrase that few people in the Marshall Islands had heard.</p>
<p>But Sarah’s timing couldn’t have been better. That December, the highest tides of the year coalesced with a massive storm, and three-meter waves swamped the Marshall Islands. Staple crops like taro and breadfruit were ruined, roads and seawalls washed out, and knee-high seawater surged into people’s homes. Graveyards flooded and tombs were destroyed.</p>
<p>As with the world’s other low-lying atoll nations, Kiribati and the Maldives, the Marshall Islands have always been susceptible to floods and typhoons. Archaeologist Marshall Weisler calls low coral atolls “the most precarious landscapes for human habitation,” bar none. One flood in 1979 became so legendary in the Marshall Islands that elders told and retold stories of the ocean coming into their homes while they slept, waves battering their walls. The 2008 flood was intense, but many wrote it off as a similar freak event, the kind of natural disaster that visits the region every few decades.</p>
<p>Except that the following year, in 2009, it happened again. And again. “Inundation events,” as they’re now euphemistically known, are no longer once-in-a-lifetime occasions. For the past few years, they’ve swamped vulnerable neighborhoods at least biannually and sometimes even more frequently, usually during the highest tides of the year. Sea levels in the western Pacific have risen by an estimated five centimeters per decade since the 1950s, and rainfall in Majuro has decreased by over a centimeter per decade. Droughts have become more frequent, too. The lack of rainwater—which people depend on to fill drinking water catchments and irrigate crops—is almost as troubling as rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Mark Stege, executive director of the Marshall Islands Conservation Society at the College of the Marshall Islands, explains that alone, the Marshallese could withstand any one of these events. But stacked atop one another, there’s a threshold: a point at which people decide that the risk of property damage, the health and safety of their children, and the stress of living in fear, overpower the desire to stay on land that’s been handed down for generations, with their family and culture intact.</p>
<p>Stege is creating models to determine where, exactly, that threshold lies. How much flood risk is too much? How many floods per year are too many? Though he hasn’t yet come up with an answer, he feels certain there will come a time when the Marshall Islands are no longer habitable. There won’t be a sudden exodus, a single moment, but over years or even decades, people will reach their personal threshold and leave.</p>

<p>No one I spoke to knows anyone who’s yet left the country because of climate change. But the country’s first climate refugees may not be far off. When the US government bombed the Marshallese island of Bikini in the 1940s and 1950s—in the name of nuclear testing—the people who lived there were given a trust fund to help them relocate. Most were forced onto the barren island of Kili, one of the few spots in the Marshall Islands without a lagoon, a feature that buffers islands from the crashing waves. Because of this inadequacy, the island is particularly vulnerable to flooding, so Bikinians are petitioning the US Congress to use the trust fund to buy land in the United States. The fund set up to help them survive nuclear testing may now help them survive climate change instead.</p>
<p>Yet the government refuses to consider a similar solution for the entire country. Doing so is akin to admitting defeat, and the Marshallese aren’t ready for that. Not yet. Undeterred, Minister deBrum travels the world, telling leaders and politicians that climate change can be reversed, that reducing greenhouse emissions can save the Marshall Islands from becoming a country of abandoned buildings being slowly devoured by salt and coconut crabs.</p>
<p>Instead of seeking asylum, the Marshallese are embracing their heritage, clinging to the essence of what makes them islanders. Traditional tattoo designs mimicking the patterns of fish scales and ocean waves have become popular after decades of disuse. A program called <em>Jaki-ed </em>is reviving the art of weaving fine clothing mats from pandanus leaves. Stege is creating a digital Noah’s Ark, a record of plants and fish whose names could be lost. And more than 300 teens and young adults have graduated from a program called <em>Waan Ael</em><em>õñ</em> <em>in Majel</em> that teaches them to build and sail dugout outrigger canoes. The program’s director, Alson Kelen, sailed one more than 3,800 kilometers, from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands, using only traditional navigation. A storm chased him for the entire three-week journey.</p>
<p>But while cultural preservation and calls for climate action are vital to maintaining Marshall Islanders’ sense of identity, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves little hope that such measures will be more than stopgaps. Mary-Elena Carr, a biological oceanographer with Columbia University, explains that even if carbon emissions stopped tomorrow, the lengthy lifespan of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that warming trends will continue unabated for the next 1,000 years. The official IPCC estimate is that global sea levels will rise between 26 and 98 centimeters by 2100, and Carr thinks even that is conservative. “I find it extremely unlikely that global average sea level rise will be below one meter by 2100,” she says. Either way, much of the Marshall Islands will be submerged.</p>

<p>From his office in downtown Majuro, which features a floor-to-ceiling photograph of an atomic bomb exploding over Bikini, Bikini’s acting mayor Wilson Note says that he knows not everyone agrees with his peoples’ decision to prepare for exodus. But Bikinians were already robbed of their homeland once. Moving to the United States won’t be much of a stretch. “Kili is dangerous now,” Note says. “Big waves come and wash over the island. We are very proud because we are the very first in the Marshall Islands to think about moving out of the Marshall Islands. We are the leaders.”</p>
<p>When I ask where they might go, he shrugs. “Maybe Hawaii. Maybe Oklahoma.”</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s a sea surrounding Oklahoma, too, but instead of a wave-flecked plain of blue, it’s a sea of farmland, a grid of fields punctuated by grain silos and pump jacks. One in five jobs in Oklahoma is supported—directly or indirectly—by the oil and natural gas industries, and as of last year, roughly 55 percent of adults in Enid, Oklahoma believed global warming is real. The national average is 63 percent.</p>
<p>Oklahoma is also the fifth most popular state for Marshallese migrants (after Arkansas, Hawaii, Washington, and California), and it’s where Sarah moved after living with her aunt for six years in Arkansas and graduating from high school there. Though Enid seems like an improbable place for Pacific Islanders to settle, it is, in a way, familiar. The first Marshallese came here with missionaries about 40 years ago, and wrote home about the jobs that could be had in meat-processing factories, and the public schools their children could attend. Eventually, family joined family.</p>
<p>I went to Enid to trace Sarah’s journey, and after settling into a sketchy motel between the Korean Church of Grace and the Wild Childs Gentlemen’s Club, I visited Enid High School, where Sarah’s cousin Ashlyn Joash works as a liaison between the school district and the Marshallese community. Ashlyn translates teachers’ notes for Marshallese parents who don’t speak English, and explains to teachers why their Marshallese students struggle with punctuality and grades. Her hope, she says, is to help Oklahomans understand who the islanders in their midst are and where they came from. (Case in point, when I told Enid High principal Jim Beierschmitt, who oversees 150 Marshallese students, out of 1,810, that I’d recently been to Majuro, he asked, “Now, where’s that?”)</p>
<p>Five years ago, the Marshallese population in Enid was 1,000. Today, it may be as high as 2,000, and is expected to double again in 10 years. Yet, though Marshallese are legal workers who gladly take undesirable, low-paying jobs, Enid hasn’t exactly welcomed them. “It’s a redneck state and we have a bad name here,” Ashlyn says later. “You hear a lot of ‘Go back where you came from, go back to the Marshall Islands!’” (Ashlyn was born and raised in Oklahoma.)</p>

<p>In 2009, Oklahoma passed legislation that English would be the only language option for driving tests. Federal social benefits such as health insurance are unavailable to Marshallese migrants who aren’t citizens. Terry Mote, Micronesian community health coordinator for the Garfield County Health Department, told me his elderly mother caught pneumonia and was hospitalized soon after he brought her to Oklahoma. Without Medicare, her bill came to $10,000. He worked two jobs to pay it off.</p>
<p>But there are also signs that things are improving. One teacher, Rita Hartwick, traveled to the Marshall Islands to learn basic weaving and cooking, and is now bringing that knowledge to her home economics classes. And after English as a Second Language teacher Jennifer Patterson noticed that Marshallese students—even with the ubiquitous skinny jeans and smartphones of American high schools—still strolled between classes strumming ukuleles and Skyped their families in Majuro to sing for children’s first birthdays, she organized a Marshallese choir to “highlight all the positive things they do.” The choir has already sung for the president of the Marshall Islands when he visited, and has been invited to sing at the Oklahoma governor’s office this Christmas. The morning I’m there, they sing their national anthem to me in Marshallese:</p>
<p>“My island lies o’er the ocean / Like a wreath of flowers upon the sea…” Their voices rise and swell. If I close my eyes, the fluorescent-lit room becomes my classroom in Ebon, humid, the salty smell of the ocean drifting through open windows. “I’ll never leave my dear home sweet home / God of our forefathers, protect and bless forever the Marshall Islands!”</p>
<p>Later, some of the students in the choir tell me they’re Bikinian and that their parents, already displaced by nuclear testing, were among the first immigrants to Enid. Because many have been unable to save enough for the $2,000 plane ticket back to Majuro, their children have never seen the ocean. When I mention I’ve been to the Marshall Islands some of the students ask, in awe, “Did you swim in the ocean? What was it like?”</p>
<hr />
<p>That Sunday, I see some of the same teenagers at the Marshallese First Assembly of God, singing Marshallese hymns and dancing beneath palm-frond weavings that look like sea turtles and the swirls of waves. After the service, there’s a party, but the only seafood to serve the guests of honor is some sort of fried fish brought in a cooler from Oklahoma City. So the pastor’s two adult granddaughters grab $40 from the collection plate, and I drive them down the road to an all-you-can-eat Asian buffet. There, the two Marshallese women, their tropical-colored muumuus standing out in a crowd of Midwestern farmers and roughnecks, fill take-out containers with steamed mussels. We joke sadly that this is fishing in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Sarah moved from Arkansas to Enid in 2013 when she got a scholarship to attend a community college. She lived with her cousin Ashlyn’s family in a crowded, dingy apartment on the west side of town. She wanted to study criminal justice. But one semester in, when she was 20, Sarah found herself pregnant.</p>
<p>Carrying a child revived the debilitating homesickness she’d experienced in those first years away from Ebon. She missed the ocean more than ever, the smell of the coconut oil women rub into their hair, the wind in the palm trees, the cook fires burning in the night. She craved the fish Jola would bring home on a strand of fishing line, the pickled papaya Rakki made. Some weeks, the only thing in Oklahoma Sarah could stomach were chocolate shakes from McDonald’s. One day she drank 12.</p>
<p>And then, on October 2, 2014, Sarah gave birth to a daughter, Marla Armonie Moana Lanwi. Like most Marshallese women, she didn’t cry out once while in labor.</p>
<p>Sarah and her boyfriend, Nimo, who grew up in Majuro, were determined that Marla would celebrate her first birthday in the Marshall Islands. Nimo worked overtime at a meat-processing plant in Enid for a year to save enough for two round-trip tickets. So in March, when Marla was six months old, Sarah carried her onto a plane bound for the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<div id="attachment_147" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA051246.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147" class="size-large wp-image-147" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PA051246-1024x768.jpg" alt="Sarah holds her daughter, Marla Armoine Moana Lanwi.

<p>When they were almost as far away from a landmass as you can possibly get, Sarah held her daughter to the airplane window so she could see, improbably, a ribbon of sand and palm trees snaking through the ocean: Aelõñ Kein Ad. These islands of ours.</p>
<p>“Tell them,” writes Marshallese poet Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner. “Tell them that we are nothing without our islands.”</p>
<p>Sarah is not a poet. She’s not a climate advocate. She’s an average Marshallese woman doing her best to help her daughter understand that she is descended from the greatest seafarers the world has ever known. But later this year, after six months in the Marshall Islands, Marla—like so many Marshallese—will leave. By the time the next king tides beat against the flimsy seawalls and wash into people’s homes, she’ll be back in Oklahoma. Unlike many Marshallese-Americans of her generation, though, Marla will later be able to say that once, she knew the ocean. She sat on her mother’s lap at the edge of the lagoon and felt the tropical water tickle her legs. She took her first steps in her paternal grandparents’ gecko-green house that rises from the sea on a piece of land sprouted from oil drums and old tires. She looked into the eyes of the sea turtle that the men speared for her first birthday feast. And, the night before her first birthday, just before midnight, she watched quietly, her brown eyes wide, as a chorus of women and children streamed into the house strumming ukuleles and singing, welcoming her to the world. To her home.</p>

<p>Seventeen-year-old Virginia Pushaina drops an orange bucket into the murky depths of an open pit to collect muddy water. It&#8217;s early morning in October, but the temperature&#8217;s already approaching 90 degrees. Crops of corn and beans have long since shriveled to dust, and emaciated goats scrounging for food in the sand no longer can feed a family or fetch a good price at market.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Six months pregnant, Pushaina often thinks about the baby son she lost to an infection two years ago. She now fears for her young daughter, who often lacks clean water and receives little nourishment apart from a few swallows of <i>chicha</i>, a fermented corn drink.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Since the region’s crippling drought began three years ago, 12 children among Pushaina&#8217;s hundred extended family members have died from malnutrition, dehydration, or illnesses caused by consuming dirty, stagnant water from the earthen wells. Many mothers in this indigenous Wayúu community on the Caribbean desert peninsula of Guajira are so malnourished that they are unable to produce milk for their babies.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Long before dawn breaks, women from the <i>ranchería</i> of Porciosa set out into the night with battered plastic containers, walking for hours across the sweltering desert to retrieve clean water from the nearest potable wells. They haul it back by burro or on bicycles, or lacking those, they carry it themselves. If they can&#8217;t carry enough to meet their families&#8217; needs, they must resort to consuming water from Porciosa&#8217;s two pit wells, which are contaminated with bacteria. It&#8217;s an arduous daily ritual carried out in Wayúu rancherías, or settlements, across the state of La Guajira.</p>

<p>The word <i>víctima</i> in Colombia has a strong association with the country&#8217;s long-running armed conflict. But as the Colombian government moves steadily toward a peace accord, it is grappling with how to respond to a new kind of victim—people forced from their homes as they suffer the effects of higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more extreme droughts and floods.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The Wayúu&#8217;s plight underscores a broader challenge for Colombia: analyzing the climate-related tipping points that could make people already suffering poverty, conflict, or other environmental threats more likely to migrate, particularly to its crowded cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It&#8217;s an emerging concern all around the world, yet consensus on the best ways forward remains elusive. When the United Nations climate talks commence in Paris on November 30, climate-related migration is likely to garner only a small amount of space in the accord&#8217;s text. That leaves individual countries to devise their own approaches to measuring migration and displacement and safeguarding rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Worldwide an average of 22.5 million people have been displaced each year since 2008 by natural disasters related to extreme weather and climate change, according to the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nrc.no/?aid=9137092#.VkyO-SnDbJ-">Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, part of the Norwegian Refugee Council.</a></p>

<p>&#8220;We are moving beyond the social conflict already occurring in the country toward a different vulnerability, and some of those [affected] people have no recognition and no future unless we try to understand what&#8217;s happening with migration,&#8221; says Elsa Garcia Salazar, an environmental monitor specializing in climate change at the Bogotá office of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.iom.int">International Organization for Migration</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Crisis in La Guajira</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>For centuries, the Wayúu have resourcefully adapted to seasonal dry periods by migrating within their territory, which extends across the border to Venezuela. But the region&#8217;s unprecedented drought is exacerbating the effects of armed conflict, environmental degradation, and government neglect, driving many in this tribe of some 400,000 to a point of crisis.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very critical, the situation of our community,&#8221; says Arico Pushaina, a community leader in Porciosa. &#8220;If the government doesn&#8217;t help us … the Wayúu will come to an end in this land.&#8221;</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Scientists at <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.ideam.gov.co/">IDEAM,</a> Colombia&#8217;s institute of hydrology and meteorology, attribute Guajira&#8217;s three-year drought to repeated El Niños, a weather phenomenon causing hot and dry conditions there. But recent research says the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n2/full/nclimate2100.html">frequency of these extreme El Niño events</a> has increased due to global warming. And with <a class="ui-link" href="http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/pubs/rp/caribbean-full-eng.pdf">more intense droughts </a>predicted for this region, the fate of the people who call this windswept desert home remains uncertain.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Across Guajira Peninsula&#8217;s 9,700 square miles, a staggering 37,000 people suffer from malnutrition, according to a <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.defensoria.gov.co/public/pdf/informedefensorialguajira11.pdf">2014 report</a> by Colombia&#8217;s Ombudsman Office. Its hunger crisis intensified in August, when Venezuela closed its border and imposed strict checkpoints to fight contraband gasoline, food, and other products flowing into Colombia. Since then, the Wayúu have found it harder to get cheaper Venezuelan goods, making a bad economy even worse.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The drought also is exacerbating another serious water woe: the damming of the Río Ranchería, the main river that flows through La Guajira. The river was dammed in large part to quench the voracious thirst of mining companies, resulting in its flow being cut off from the Wayúu. The Wayúu are now <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.las2orillas.co/como-llego-el-caso-wayuu-la-cidh/">petitioning</a> the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to restore their access.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>No one in Porciosa has yet migrated outside of traditional Wayúu territory. But in nearby communities, some—particularly younger people—have left for other Colombian states, according to local leaders.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Garcia wants to know whether the drought is altering the Wayúu&#8217;s traditional migration patterns and pushing them in greater numbers toward urban areas and neighboring states. There&#8217;s an urgent need, she says, for rigorous data collection tools that can aid policymakers in understanding how phenomena linked to climate change are contributing to human migration—not only in La Guajira but throughout the country.</p>

<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p><a class="ui-link" href="http://www.cgdev.org/page/mapping-impacts-climate-change">One study</a> ranks Colombia 18th in the world for climate change risks—two to three times the risk of neighboring Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador: From expansive agricultural lands to urban centers in the Andes to nearly 2,000 miles of coastline, the majority of Colombians live in places likely to be affected by extreme weather, sea level rise, and other phenomena exacerbated by global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of challenges with climate change issues,&#8221; says Rodrigo Suárez Castaño, director of the climate change division at Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. &#8220;If things keep going this way, we&#8217;re going to have more people moving and more people living in cities. It&#8217;s a big question and challenge we have on our hands.&#8221;</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Colombia&#8217;s Wake-up Call</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Last year, Colombia became one of the first countries in South America to include migration in its <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.minambiente.gov.co/index.php/component/content/article/476-plantilla-cambio-climatico-32">national climate change adaptation plan</a>.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>A pivotal event for the Colombian government in recognizing the potential for climate-induced migration was the devastating, widespread La Niña floods in 2010 and 2011, which affected more than three million people throughout the country. There is no clear data on how many people were ultimately displaced, but flooding and mudslides damaged nearly 500,000 homes and affected millions of acres of agricultural lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>It was a wake-up call. Following the floods, the government collaborated with the International Organization for Migration to track 2,000 people who had been displaced—an initial step toward a national climate migration study. The survey revealed trends similar to those seen in conflict displacement. Two years after the floods, nearly half had not yet returned home. Many had migrated to large cities like Medellín, Bogotá, and Cartagena.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Like those displaced by conflict, people displaced by the flooding lost property, income, and social support networks. They often settled informally on the fringe of cities in undesirable areas lacking basic infrastructure. People arriving from rural agricultural regions also tended to lack skills necessary to find jobs in an urban economy.</p>
<div id="attachment_322" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-image-322 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg" alt="DSC_0662" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0662-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-322" class="wp-caption-text">Wayuu women return to Porciosa after filling plastic containers with dirty water from the village&#8217;s two artisanal wells.  (Credit: Autumn Spanne)</p></div>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The small study underscored that cities need to be prepared to receive new migrants as part of their own climate adaptation plans. So far, they lack systems for preparing for them.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>Can the Cities Cope?</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Take the Colombian city of Cartagena. The city is home to tens of thousands of displaced conflict victims, many of whom settle informally along the major coastal lagoon of Cienaga de la Virgen with no sewer, water, or other municipal services. The arrival of more people because of climate-related phenomena—like flooding to the city&#8217;s south, rising seas that threaten the islands off its coast, and drought in La Guajira—will add to the pressures.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>But while Cartagena has one of the most advanced adaptation plans in the region, the city hasn&#8217;t yet developed a strategy for climate migration. Suárez says the national government is supporting such efforts by providing guidelines.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t make a commitment to getting solid data about patterns of climate migration, we will not have adequate tools for decision-making,&#8221; says Dolly González, Cartagena&#8217;s city planning director. &#8220;People who arrive in Cartagena because of climate change are staying outside of the government aid programs, because the focus has been conflict.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Beyond counting and tracking migrants, governments face challenges in developing legal mechanisms to provide ongoing support after initial crises like floods and fires. In Colombia, those fleeing extreme weather aren&#8217;t covered by the same laws that protect the rights of conflict-displaced migrants. So far, there isn&#8217;t even a standardized international definition of what constitutes a climate migrant.</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The big question now is whether migration and displacement will be included in a new UN climate accord. Ahead of Paris, some developing nations proposed a new entity to organize humanitarian responses to climate-related disasters.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>There&#8217;s general agreement that climate migration will grow in coming decades, notes Walter Kaelin of the <a class="ui-link" href="https://www.nanseninitiative.org">Nansen Initiative</a>, which is working to improve international responses to people displaced by natural disasters. But providing compensation for affected countries is a sticking point. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have something in the Paris outcome, it will be much more difficult to keep this on the list of priorities,&#8221; he says.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<h2><b>A Plea to Preserve a Culture</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Back in Porciosa, Virginia Pushaina watches her 19-month-old daughter grow weak and cry for food. She notices that the toddler has the same skin rash that her son developed before contracting a fatal infection. But she doesn&#8217;t have much time to dwell on such unsettling thoughts. Each day she must give herself completely to the present: tending her daughter, walking miles to fetch water, and making <i>mochilas</i>, intricately-woven cotton bags popular with tourists that have become crucial to the economic survival of many Wayúu families.</p>
<div id="attachment_321" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-321" class="wp-image-321" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-683x1024.jpg" alt="DSC_0714" width="505" height="757" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-200x300.jpg 200w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSC_0714-533x800.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-321" class="wp-caption-text">Virginia Pushaina stands at the grave of her 11-month-old son, who died two years ago of an infection that she believes was caused by drinking dirty water from the community&#8217;s artisanal open pit wells. (Credit: Autumn Spanne)</p></div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Arico Pushaina pleads for greater government investment, including deeper wells, new windmills and solar pumps, medical clinics, and programs that allow artisans to get a fairer price for their goods.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>He worries that, if La Guajira&#8217;s droughts become more intense and prolonged, the young will no longer be able to rely on traditional economic activities such as livestock and subsistence agriculture. What future will the Wayúu have, he wonders, if they are forced to leave for crime-ridden cities, far removed from their culture?</p>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>His uncertainty about the future also stems from another source. Contaminated water has contributed to the death of ten elders since the drought began, says Pushaina. With them goes their precious cultural knowledge, including the <a class="ui-link" href="http://www.festival.si.edu/blog/2013/what-did-you-dream-wayuu-dream-interpretation/">Wayúu tradition</a> of using dreams to plan for the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>&#8220;When they interpret dreams, they inform the community about what&#8217;s to come. It has really affected us, the [loss of] elders,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We no longer know what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Sami reindeer herders are facing an external threat to keeping their centuries-old tradition alive – climate change. According to scientists, the Arctic region, home to the Sami people, is warming at a rate 2.5 times faster than the global average.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/147480382" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>On a dark, chilly November evening on the frozen Raisjavri Lake in northern Norway, Jonna Andreas Utsi and his colleagues dragged out one reindeer after another from their trailers. With a firm yet gentle grip, Utsi lay the reindeer down on the icy lake top and began untying the ropes around their feet. He occasionally made herding sounds to calm the reindeer, who stared back with their large, dark, fearful eyes.</p>
<p>Utsi and his family are Sami reindeer herders in Norway’s northern Finnmark region close to the Barents Sea. The Sami are an <a href="http://www.unric.org/en/indigenous-people/27307-the-sami-of-northern-europe--one-people-four-countries">indigenous group in Europe</a> that live in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia – a region known as Sápmi. Historical records show that Sami people have been herding reindeer <a href="http://reindeerherding.org/herders/sami-norway/">since 800 AD</a> while sustaining a nomadic way of life, moving annually between their summer and winter pastures. Only about 10 percent of the estimated 70,000 Sami people still follow the tradition of reindeer herding.</p>
<div id="attachment_283" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-10.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-283" class="wp-image-283 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-10-1024x684.jpg" alt="Jonna herds reindeer with the help of his dog and his all terrain vehicle. “Things are much easier because of that, but on the other hand, it’s also not so nice to be so mobile all the time.

(Credit: Felix Gaedtke)</p></div>
<p>Earlier that evening Utsi and his fellow herders had fetched about 20 reindeer that had wandered away from their herd of about 2,500 and joined another one. “That happens quite often. It is a big loss if we lose our reindeer to someone else,” Utsi said. He pointed towards a reindeer’s earmark, a few cuts on each ear marked while they are still calves, “This mark is mine. That means the reindeer belongs to me. My cousin has his own ear mark and my friend has his own. That helps us differentiate our reindeer from the others.”</p>
<p>Utsi began herding in his late teens after his father, also a reindeer herder, passed away. “It was a bit hard, losing my dad at a young age. It wasn’t easy to find advice or someone who could tell me how to do things. But I was connected to the reindeer, they taught me herding. I also had grandparents and relatives who helped me to learn more,” he said. Today Utsi works alongside members of his extended family – a common practice among Sami herders.</p>
<p>“Being Sami and being indigenous is our identity. Reindeer herding has been in the Sami community for hundreds of years. Sami people and reindeer are like one, we are connected together,” Utsi said proudly, “Even the months of the year in Sami calendar are named according to reindeer herding cycles.”</p>
<h2><strong>A new threat</strong></h2>
<p>However in recent years, Utsi and other Sami reindeer herders are facing an external threat to keeping their centuries-old tradition alive – climate change. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter15.pdf">According to scientists</a>, the Arctic region, home to the Sami people, is warming at a rate 2.5 times faster than the global average.</p>
<div id="attachment_276" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-276" class="size-large wp-image-276" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sami-Reindeer-Herders-in-the-Arctic-3-1024x684.jpg" alt="According to climate scientists, the temperature in the Arctic is warming 2.5 times faster than the rest of the world.

(Credit: Felix Gaedtke)</p></div>
<p>The effects of increased temperatures are already visible on the frozen landscape. As Utsi rode his all-terrain vehicle (ATV) across the frozen Raisjavri Lake the following morning, he stopped over a partly frozen spot. “This is climate change. We see it every day in our work and life,” he said. “Normally during this time of the year the temperature is between -20ºC and -30ºC. But it’s really warm this year, it’s -4ºC. We have had warm autumns previously but never earlier were they so long.”</p>
<p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/05/arctic-ice-retreat-scientists-climate-change">less ice in the Arctic this winter</a> than any previous year since the beginning of satellite monitoring. Utsi got off his ATV, walked a bit further and knelt down. “Look, here,” he said, clearing the snow on the ground, “There’s snow on the surface and then ice at the bottom, above the ground. The reindeer can get through the snow, but not through the ice. They can’t get to the food.”</p>
<p>Lack of forage is one of the biggest impacts of climate change on reindeer herding. Increased precipitation due to warmer temperatures is leading to harder ice on the surface close to the ground, locking away the lichen and other plants that reindeer feed on. In the past, this has led to the herd’s starvation and even death.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if your refrigerator is full of food, but you can’t open the door,” said Anders Oskal, executive director at the <a href="http://reindeerherding.org/about-us/">International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR)</a> in Kautokeino, a town in northern Norway. Oskal went on to outline another indicator of climate change. “We have seen shrubs entering the tundra in ways it hasn’t done before,” he said, referring to a type of vegetation that the reindeer don’t eat. “There are a lot of traditional migration routes that families here have used for centuries. We can’t use these migration routes any more &#8212; the reindeer refuse to go there because there are too many shrubs. This tells us that something beyond the ordinary is happening.”</p>

(Credit: Felix Gaedtke)</p></div>
<p>The ICR offers capacity building workshops to reindeer herders across the world. One of their areas of focus is promoting traditional indigenous knowledge that helps mitigate effects of climate change. “None of the 24 indigenous groups around the world herding reindeer has the term ‘sustainable development’ in our languages. Where did that term originate? To us it’s a given. We would like to see our children and their children to continue the life that we are living,” Oskal said.</p>
<p>He pulled out a poster that explained how traditional Sami knowledge and practices can help to mitigate the effects of climate change. “You can design your reindeer herd. Male castrates are the biggest and strongest animals in the herd. It calms the herd down and more importantly, they are stronger and able to dig through hard snow and face difficult conditions in winter time. This is important because the climate is not just being warmed but also more variable,” he said. Herders across Sápmi have chosen to have more and more inactive male reindeer as a result.</p>
<p>But it’s not just warmer temperatures that are posing a risk to reindeer herding. “A warmer Arctic is also a more accessible Arctic, explained Oskal. “Loss of pastures due to encroachment and fragmentation of pasture land for reindeer herders is one of the most serious challenges that we are facing today. Studies suggest that in the last 50 years, reindeer husbandry has lost 25 percent of land in the Barents region to encroachment,” Oskal explained. Over the past 30 years, reindeer herders have lost pastures to military fields, windmills, power lines and road construction.</p>
<h2><strong>An uphill climb </strong></h2>
<p>With many of these industries sprouting up in and around Sápmi, the younger generation is shifting away from traditional practices. Thirty four-year-old Johan Ailo Hætta, who comes from a reindeer herding family, runs a car rental company Ailo Matki &amp; Tourist in Kautokeino. “I feel sad about not continuing the tradition, but on the other hand I have the option of going out in nature and spending time there as long as I want and returning when I feel like,” he said.</p>
<p>“My business is really successful, a lot of Kroner,” Hætta joked standing outside his garage on a snowy morning. “There isn’t any other car rental company around here, so my cars are always rented out. Moreover, I employ a few young guys, so I am generating employment here,” Hætta said.</p>
<p>While decades ago, Sami reindeer herders lived nomadically in tents called <em>lavvus</em>, today they most often have permanent residences. In the 1970s, Sápmi experienced something called a “<u><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/255578485_Logical_Adaptation_to_Modern_Technology_-_Snowmobile_Revolution_in_Spmi">snowmobile revolution</a></u>,” which allowed herders more mobility and easier herding. “My grandfather would be skiing to herd and they used reindeer for transportation to get food to the tents. They also faced hard conditions in the winter. They just had one little bag of food, the dog, a gun to get reindeer, coffee and bread – hard, old bread,” Jonna Utsi recalled.</p>

<p>Utsi’s permanent home is located on the outskirts of Kautokeino town. A huge, red wooden building with rows of reindeer skin hanging outside. Utsi now divides his time between the herd and his family. On a Wednesday afternoon, while Utsi was home, he prepared a lunch of fried redfish and salad with his fiancé Briita-Marja Nutti. Their two-year-old son Jonna-Isaak played with a board game on the floor.</p>
<p>“A lot of knowledge is gone because we aren’t living with the herd and following it always,” said Nutti, a 29-year-old massage therapist. “Already when I was growing up, this changed. My father was always with the herd and coming to visit us – I don’t know how often he was away,” she said.</p>
<p>Utsi brought out a reindeer game for his son. Together they starting building the toy fence and arranging the miniature reindeer inside it. The boy took out his toy knife and marked a calf. “I hope my son will be a herder too. I hope the climate gets better,” Utsi said, “but the change is happening very fast.”</p>
<p>Changes that he never expected to see in his lifetime, he said, have taken place in only the last ten years. “That is pretty frightening,” Utsi acknowledged. “If there’s going to be so many changes, maybe we have to give up herding. That is going to be a punishment for our culture and language and everything.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indigenous hunter Jim Antoine has watched the decline of caribou herds with alarm, convinced that global warming is at least partially responsible for the crisis in Canada&#8217;s far north.</p>
<p>An important food source for the Dene people, an indigenous group living in the northern boreal and Arctic regions of Canada, as well as for other northern communities, the caribou population has crashed in recent years. Scientists, hunters and government officials say there are several possible causes for the fall in numbers of the woodland caribou that prefer cooler conditions, but climate change is likely a significant driver.</p>
<p>In parts of the Northwest Territories, average annual temperatures have already risen more than three degrees over the past two decades, a local politician said, impacting everything from housing and transportation to the local caribou population. This comes amid rising fears that the world is not on track to limit greenhouse gas emissions to keep temperatures within a U.N. goal of two degrees Celsius (3.6 F) above pre-industrial times, which will be debated at a global conference in December.</p>

<p>&#8220;We live with (climate change) every day,&#8221; Antoine said at his home in Fort Simpson, a mostly Dene community of about 1,200 residents just over 500 kilometers south of the Arctic Circle. Piles of moose meat from a recent hunt sit on a table in his garage. A large man with thinning silver hair and wry smile, Antoine led the Northwest Territories as Premier in the late 1990s, giving him a front row seat on the changes taking place in the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the old days, it stayed cold for a longer time and there was more water on the land &#8230; all of that will impact the animals,&#8221; Antoine said between bites of moose meat and sips of tea during a late night interview in his comfortable, suburban-style home.</p>
<p>The caribou crisis is one manifestation of climate change facing residents in a region considered the &#8220;canary in the coal mine&#8221; by environmentalists, as global warming is felt here first and often with more intensity than other areas. The Arctic ecosystems, Greenland ice sheet, and tropical coral reefs are systems earmarked as particularly vulnerable to increased temperatures.</p>
<p>Scientists fear the vast, frigid Arctic region is warming at twice the rate of other parts of the globe, which threatens traditional communities even as it opens up new sea lanes and vast oil and mineral resources.</p>
<p>Wildlife are particularly affected by the changes. The number of breeding females in one major caribou herd, a key population indicator, dropped by half between 2015 and 2012, the territorial government said in late September.</p>
<p>In 1986, the herd was approximately 470,000 strong. Now it&#8217;s down to about 16,000.</p>
<p>As warming continues across the once frozen north, residents worry the situation will get worse. With hunted meat drying above the stove, a roaring wood fire keeping the place warm, and massive hunting dogs roaming around, Joseph Antoine, a relative of Jim&#8217;s with decades of experience on the land, worries about the future. &#8220;This decline of the caribou is not going to stop,&#8221; Joseph said. &#8220;Certain areas had a huge amount of caribou at one time.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_60" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Moose4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-60" class="size-large wp-image-60" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Moose4-1024x768.jpg" alt="Joseph Antoine and Deneze Antoine hunt in the Northwest Territories, Canada.

<p>While indigenous hunters are feeling the effects of climate change first, the problems they have faced over the past two decades with increasing ferocity will invariably impact larger populations further south, scientists said.</p>
<h2>Permafrost melt</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are causing the Arctic to warm twice as fast as the global average, according to a Cambridge University study released in September. As permafrost melts due to rising temperatures, long buried carbon dioxide and methane seep from the ground, creating a potentially catastrophic feedback loop. The expected cost of melting permafrost, according to the Cambridge study, could soar to $43 trillion in economic damage by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Earlier melts and later freezing of winter ice could be part of the reason for reduced caribou populations, scientists said, as normal migration routes to breeding grounds or winter food sources are disrupted.</p>
<p>The crash in the caribou population is not unique to Canada with similar declines happening across the north, said Nancy Maynard, an Emeritus Scientist with NASA. The numbers of reindeer &#8211; a cousin of the caribou &#8211; in Norway and Russia&#8217;s eastern regions are also declining rapidly, she said, citing ice melts, increased forest fires linked to warming, and industrial development as possible causes.</p>
<p>During the winter months, caribou survive by using their hooves to dig through deep piles of snow to reach lichen and other plants buried underneath. But warmer temperatures have led to winter snow melts or rain on the snow, which later freezes, forming layers of ice interspersed with deep snow.</p>
<p>This means the caribou can&#8217;t break through the ice to forage for food and can sometimes starve due to &#8220;pasture lockout&#8221;, Maynard said. &#8220;The changes are happening so fast and it&#8217;s dramatic how people are forced to cope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rate of change has accelerated and it has been surprising scientists,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Particularly over the last few years, extreme and unpredictable weather has become really noticeable and measurable.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Healthy eating imperiled</h2>
<p>In northern villages like Fort Simpson, caribou hunting isn&#8217;t just a cultural practice honed over generations, or a marker of indigenous identity, but essential to the local diet. The meat represents a key food source in a region where groceries normally cost more than double southern prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are nutritionally affected by the caribou (decline),&#8221; Bob Bromley, a politician said during an interview at the legislature in the territorial capital Yellowknife. &#8220;They have been raised on caribou and their bodies are adjusted to deal with that kind of food. Store bought food is not as healthy and usually has higher fat and sugar content than they are used to.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_51" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1387.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-51" class="size-large wp-image-51" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1387-1024x768.jpg" alt="Moose meat hanging in the kitchen (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)" width="760" height="570" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1387-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1387-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-51" class="wp-caption-text">Moose meat hanging in the kitchen (Credit: Christopher Arsenault)</p></div>
<p>With the decline in animal populations, and a reliance on expensive store-bought food, much of the north fares poorly for health indicators. Obesity is rising, physical activity is declining and lifestyle related ailments like diabetes and cancer are increasing across the Northwest Territories, with indigenous people particularly affected, the government said in a 2014 report. It did not provide specific statistics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to draw a direct link between negative health indicators and global warming, but residents across the region said they believed there was a connection.</p>
<p>In some small communities, people depend on traditional foods for up to a third of what they eat, said Jessie Mackenzie from the Institute for Circumpolar Health Research. &#8220;(Almost) every household has someone who hunts or traps for food,&#8221; the Dene researcher said. &#8220;The warmer temperatures are causing the caribou to become more food insecure, and we, in turn, become more food insecure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across northern Canada, the number of people depending on food aid more than doubled between 2013 and 2008, according to a report from Food Banks Canada. More than 3,500 people in Canada&#8217;s three northern regions &#8211; the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories &#8211;  now depend on food assistance in a &#8220;dire public health emergency&#8221;, the report said.</p>
<p>Along with the decline in caribou, high transportation costs of trucking or flying food throughout the Northwest Territories, an area larger than Egypt with a population of less than 50,000, also stoke food insecurity. Vegetables and other fresh foods are particularly expensive, leading some residents to opt for cheaper pasta or canned goods, exacerbating health problems.</p>
<h2>SAFETY ISSUES</h2>
<p>When moose, caribou or other large animals are available for hunting, ice melts and changes in the land due to warming are making life harder, and less safe for hunters, residents and scientists said. Many residents hunt on snowmobiles and rely on traditional knowledge of ice thickness to navigate the region&#8217;s frozen lakes and rivers with four to five feet of snow on the ground in winter.</p>
<p>With global warming, the ice in some northern regions isn&#8217;t freezing as deeply and is melting earlier, said Jamal Shirley, a manager at the Nunavut Research Institute in Canada&#8217;s northernmost territory.</p>
<p>According to Shirley, a number of younger people, who often don&#8217;t have enough traditional knowledge to know when the ice is safe, have died in recent years by falling through weak ice when fishing.</p>
<p>Problems like these can&#8217;t be blamed on climate change alone, he acknowledged, citing historical trauma faced by indigenous residents due to colonization, language loss, food insecurity and other contributing factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;With all of these factors occurring at the same time as climate change, it&#8217;s hard to look at the challenges in isolation,&#8221; said Shirley. &#8220;Ultimately, nature is in control here and human beings are vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>That vulnerability is increasing in some regions, as the weather becomes more erratic due to climate change. Some residents, including Jim Antoine, believe a five degree rise in northern temperatures is likely if current trends continue based recent rises and the amount of carbon dioxide still being emitted into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Few have faith that their situation will improve following another round of United Nations climate negotiations in Paris in December where the 193 member nations are due to agree on a new global deal to slow climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The countries doing the polluting aren&#8217;t going to stop,&#8221; said Antoine. &#8220;We aren&#8217;t the ones causing climate change, but we are the ones living with it.&#8221;</p>
