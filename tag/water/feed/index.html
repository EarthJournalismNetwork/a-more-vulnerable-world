								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking wells in the villages of southwest Bangladesh have been contaminated with salty ocean water for so long, people have gotten used to the taste. Now, scientists think that worsening salinity could be having dire, long-lasting health effects on the people living in the region — and climate change is likely to blame.</p>
<p>The world’s nations are meeting in Paris to address climate change and work towards an agreement that would limit global warming to two degrees celsius. But even if an ambitious, legally binding agreement is made, many coastal communities worldwide, including those in India and in American states like Florida, will face freshwater shortages in the coming decades as oceans continue to rise and further contaminate drinking water.</p>

<p>As a low-lying country in which nearly a third of the population lives below the poverty line, Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable. Already, scientists and researchers are <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/bangladesh-mapping-climate-change-and-food-security">referring to</a> Bangladesh as the “ground zero” of climate change, foreshadowing the water shortages that will likely spread around the world and affect more than one billion people by 2060, <a href="http://cegis.usgs.gov/pdf/sea_level_rise_text.pdf">according to</a> the United States Geological Survey.</p>
<p>“Bangladesh stands at the forefront of saltwater contamination,” said Aneire Khan, a consultant for the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Research, Bangladesh. She was the first to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230389/">broach</a> the topic four years ago in a study conducted in Dacope, a small administrative district in coastal southwest Bangladesh. “However, the same trend potentially affects all 11 Asian large river deltas, and other major deltas, notably the Nile and the Mississippi,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_607" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Coastal-Village.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-607" class="size-large wp-image-607" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Coastal-Village-1024x683.jpg" alt="Boats docked in a coastal village (Credit: Mofizur Rahman)" width="760" height="507" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Coastal-Village-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-607" class="wp-caption-text">Boats docked in a coastal village (Credit: Mofizur Rahman)</p></div>
<p>When Khan visited Dacope’s local hospital, she discovered alarming rates of high blood pressure-related conditions among pregnant women which she linked to high salt content in local drinking water sources.</p>
<p>Khan and her team measured blood pressure and took urine samples from women in the community and found that the number of hypertension cases was almost eight times higher than in non-coastal regions of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>High blood pressure is among the lead causes of maternal death in developing countries, <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/">according to</a> the World Health Organisation. Heavy salt intake increases the risk for coronary heart disease, which is the single most important risk factor for stroke, Khan explained. High blood pressure also makes pregnant women particularly vulnerable to a condition called pre-eclampsia, which can lead to severe headaches, organ damage, and even death.</p>
<p>Khan’s study caught the attention of Susmita Dasgupta,<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/susmita-dasgupta"> lead environmental economist</a> for the Development Research Group at the World Bank.</p>

<p>With a team of researchers, Dasgupta began to investigate how saltwater consumption during pregnancy affects infants. She <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/02/24046975/drinking-water-salinity-infant-mortality-coastal-bangladesh">found</a> that babies whose mothers consumed saltwater during the last month of pregnancy were at risk. Indeed, their survival rates were as badly affected as by other factors known to determine infant mortality, such as a mother’s age, education and availability of toilet facilities.</p>
<p>Dasgupta also noted that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing salinity problems.</p>
<p>The rising seas and increased storm surge in coastal Bangladesh breach groundwater wells and rivers, turning these water sources salty. Even though freshwater is abundant during the monsoons, resulting in major floods, it’s the opposite during winter. As the ground dries up and rainfall peters out, salt stays behind. During this dry season, the level of salt concentration in drinking water can reach as high as eight times what is deemed safe by the World Health Organisation, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230389/">according to research</a> from Imperial College in London. This is worsened by shrimp water farming in these regions.</p>

<p>The issue is not new – communities in southwest Bangladesh have battled the rise of the ocean and violent typhoons for decades. But with each passing year, the problem worsens at an unprecedented rate. The typhoons that accompany climate change have gotten stronger, and Khan found that drinking water sources as far as 100 kilometres inland Bangladesh are turning into brine. Research <a href="http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.s.plant.201401.02.html">shows</a> that in the last 35 years, salinity in the country has increased by 26 percent, putting the 40 million people who live in coastal Bangladesh in danger.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is rapidly disappearing under the sea, and its people are increasingly forced to adapt or to simply move to parts less vulnerable to flooding and salinity.</p>
<p>Numerous NGOs and international organisations, like BRAC, Shushilan, the World Bank, and Concern International are trying to solve the issue and prevent a mass exodus of people from the coastal parts of the country.</p>

<p>There are three main ways that NGOs and the Bangladeshi government are trying to improve freshwater access in these areas, said Santanu Lahiri, a water supply and sanitation expert for the World Bank. The most traditional of these approaches involve building standing freshwater ponds, where rainwater is collected and stored for the dry season. However, this is hardly fool proof — as these ponds can remain unsheltered from the elements, the water sometimes evaporates and can be contaminated by outside sources, said Yan Zheng, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Instead, some scientists are adopting a second method, explained Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of environmental science at Vanderbilt University who has conducted extensive fieldwork on flooding in southwest Bangladesh. They are setting up aquifer recharge stations, where freshwater is pumped deep into the ground. Once there, it can be stored without risk of contamination for up to two years, said Gilligan.</p>
<div id="attachment_604" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8424919007_94c0deb681_k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-604" class="size-large wp-image-604" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/8424919007_94c0deb681_k-1024x683.jpg" alt="A road side water tap.

(Credit: Asian Development Bank)</p></div>
<p>A third method is that of reverse osmosis, added Lahiri, which removes salt from the water to make it potable. But this is an expensive and time-consuming proposition, requiring financing, proper management and regular maintenance — all things that these small communities often are unequipped with, according to Zheng.</p>
<p>In a country plagued by political instability and poverty, it may take years for solutions to spread across the region. While major NGOs and even governments like the European Union are investing into projects and research, many of these projects are still at an experimental stage. Implementation continues to prove a challenge, with limited funding, fragmented resources and difficulty in accessing the areas that are worst affected.</p>
<p>“We can&#8217;t deliver sustainable development without taking urgent action to tackle climate change and supporting the communities already suffering from its impacts,” <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-saleemul-huq/the-green-thread_b_8149614.html?ir=India&amp;adsSiteOverride=in">said</a> Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change Development in Bangladesh and a regular attendee at the international United Nations climate change meetings. “In Paris, governments can start delivering on their newly enshrined development goals.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jordan Valley, which encompasses modern day Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, has long been considered the region’s food basket. But the once cascading waters of the Jordan River – the lifeblood of its fertile grounds – have been reduced in many places to a mere trickle, victim of transboundary squabbling over water rights that is devastating the traditional livelihoods of the region’s Palestinian farmers.</p>
<p>Now it’s climate change that is exacting a heavy toll.</p>
<p>Captured by the Israelis from Jordan in 1967, the valley has become a central issue in recent peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. To Israel, it’s as a critical piece of their defense and intelligence capabilities, while many Palestinians say the occupation isn’t about security, but access to resources. According to World Bank estimates, tight Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to agricultural land and water resources in the Jordan Valley is costing the Palestinian economy more than $700 million per year.</p>
<p>But historically low rainfall rates and warming temperatures are placing additional pressure on disputed water resources. In recent years, dozens of aquifers have dried up and many fear the Jordan Valley, which lies 100 to 450 meters below sea level, will turn into an arid desert if water is eventually depleted.</p>
<div id="attachment_370" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-370" class="size-full wp-image-370" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/4-2.jpg" alt="The barren village of Fayasel in the Jordan Valley (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/4-2-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-370" class="wp-caption-text">The barren village of Fasayel in the Jordan Valley (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>According to a recent report issued by the Palestinian Environmental Center, this past summer was the hottest in decades. Temperatures rose 10 degrees Celsius over monthly averages in Jericho and other parts of the Jordan Valley, in some cases surpassing 50ºC (about 122ºF).</p>
<p>For the valley’s Palestinian farmers, water is already a scarce commodity. Many say there is often not enough water for basic necessities, let alone enough for their livestock or to practice traditional year-round cultivation.</p>
<p>“About 20 years ago, agriculture flourished in my village and we were self-sufficient,” says Mahmoud Saleh Suleiman, a 64-year-old farmer. “But during the past few years, water started to gradually dry up for many reasons.” One of those reasons, he believes, is climate change. “Especially in summer,” he says, “the temperature has increased, drying up water aquifers.”</p>
<p>The head of the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority, Adalah Atiri, says that prevailing drought conditions are having a major impact in the West Bank, in turn affecting the food and agricultural sector. “We assume the worst possibilities to enable us to tackle issues such as a fall in rainfall of 10-20 percent by 2020 as a result of climate change,” Atiri says, “Work is needed to find solutions and adapt to these changes.”</p>
<h2>Challenging political environment</h2>
<p>But any solutions that ignore the complex political realities on the ground are insufficient.</p>
<p>Approximately 80,000 Palestinians live in the Jordan Valley, but strict Israeli measures restrict them from accessing 94 percent of available land, according to a 2015 Human Rights Watch report. Instead, Israel has allocated the majority of the valley’s land, about 86 percent, to regional councils who protect the interests of its 9,500 Israeli settlers. According to World Bank estimates, each settler receives an average of 300 liters per capita per day, about four times the amount available to Palestinians across the West Bank.</p>
<p>Villages that used to sustainably produce crops have seen their once abundant supplies of water dry up, much of it diverted to the nearby farms of Israeli settlers. Wells are often antiquated and in desperate need of repair, but it’s difficult to get the necessary permits to fix them as many lie in Area C – a security zone where Israel maintains full control.</p>
<p>In Suleiman’s hometown of Fasayel, more than 95 percent of the village’s 2,000 residents are farmers, but due to chronic water shortages, local agricultural production has ceased completely. Many now work for Israeli farms along the outskirts of the town, an industry that has been sharply criticized by human rights groups for labor violations.</p>
<p>“While the village population has doubled during the last twenty years,” Suleiman says, “our share of water has remained the same and we are obliged to buy water to meet our daily needs, as well as needs for cultivation.” But this resource comes at a steep price.</p>
<div id="attachment_372" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-372" class="size-full wp-image-372" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/3.jpg" alt="Farmer Mahmoud Saleh Suleiman (Credit: Abeer Ismail)" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3.jpg 720w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-372" class="wp-caption-text">Farmer Mahmoud Saleh Suleiman (Credit: Abeer Ismail)</p></div>
<p>Dr. Abdel Rahman Tamimi, director of the Palestinian Hydology Group, says that continuous reductions in water supplies have forced Palestinians to buy water from the Israeli authorities at inflated prices. The price of one cubic meter of treated water is 5 shekels, Tamimi says, “but the Israelis take advantage of Palestinian demand for water and sell it at 25 shekels for one cubic meter, especially in Hebron and the Jordan Valley area, where people spend around 12 percent of their monthly income on water.”</p>
<p>According to Tamimi, factors such as climate change and Israeli control over supply have restricted daily individual consumption from an average of 80 liters to only 40. In some cases it’s much less, but each is below the 100 liters per day recommended by the World Health Organization. “In southern Hebron,” he says, “the per capita share of water is only 10 liters and people in that area are obliged to buy water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmer Youself Sawafta owns several <em>dunums </em>of land in Bardala (each <em>dunum </em>is equal to 100 square meters), the lowest agricultural strip on earth. The last three years, he says, have been some of the most difficult due to the adverse effects of hot weather on agriculture and water supplies. Despite his best efforts to reduce reliance on water-intensive crops, his output remains meager. “For more than a year, we have been trying to cultivate crops that do not need much water, such as barley,” he says. “We barely have sufficient water for our daily use, let alone cultivation.”</p>
<p>Sawafta says that tight restrictions on what little water is available for agriculture only makes things worse. “In the past, we were allowed to extract 400 cubic meters per hour,” he says. “The occupation allocated us only 80 cubic meters per hour, which is insufficient to cultivate any type of vegetable.”</p>

<p>What does remain is cost prohibitive for most Palestinian farmers. Sawafta says his annual water bill is more than 100 thousand shekels (approximately $26,000) and he depends on help from international aid organizations to cover the bill. But it’s a high sum for the poor agricultural region, where the average annual per capita income is $2,000.</p>
<p>According to Sawafta, Israeli authorities have reduced the volume of water allocated to Bardala since 2000 in order to supply nearby settlements. Two wells built before 1967 to provide the village with water are fitted with meters to monitor use. A guard, he says, prevents anyone from approaching them. Deeper wells dug by Israel’s National Water Company, Mekorot, are close by.</p>
<h2>A region-wide problem?</h2>
<p>Mekorot director Ori Shani disputes the notion that Israel is the cause of water shortages faced by Palestinians. Severe drought, he says, is putting pressure not only on the West Bank, but also Israel and other neighboring countries. “Climate change has affected the volume of water and the seasons,” says Shani, “some seasons have become longer than others, causing drought in certain areas and less water in springs, a phenomenon that did not previously exist.”</p>
<p>He says visible impacts such as reduced water levels in the Sea of Galilee (Tiberias Lake) have prompted both sides to seek solutions, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been negligent in its approach to solving the crisis.</p>
<p>“The PA has not attempted to reduce water consumption by the public and has also failed to implement any projects to tackle the water shortage, such as the treatment of wastewater for cultivation purposes,” he says. “This can reduce the water shortage by 30 percent, exactly as it has done in Israel.”</p>
<p>Reduced water to villages is therefore not a problem with supply, he says, but with demand. “We supply Palestinians with double the quantity of water stipulated in agreements signed between Palestinians and Israelis,” says Shani, “the quantity of water supplied to areas inside the Green Line is much higher than that supplied to settlements.”</p>
<p>Humanitarian organizations estimate that 100,000 <em>dunums</em> of agricultural land in the Jordan Valley is affected by water shortages, forcing many farmers each year to pack up and leave. Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) head Mazen Ghneim acknowledges that climate change has played a role in reducing underground aquifers and increasing drought, but says the crisis would be greatly reduced if Israel ceased control over the valley’s water supply. According to PWA estimates, the average Palestinian in the Jordan Valley receives an average daily share of 30 liters, compared to the daily per capita share of 500 liters for an Israeli settler.</p>

<p>The way Ghneim sees it, Palestinians face few choices – either buy water back from Israel at inflated prices or attempt to renovate outdated wells. The second option is difficult and requires approval from the Israeli government, he says, which comes few and far between. But Mekorot’s Ori Shani says that it’s the Palestinian Authority government that’s been slow to begin approved renovations. “In the Joint Palestinian-Israeli Water Committee,” he says, “we Israelis agreed to renovate 60 wells in the West Bank, but the PA has not yet started the implementation of these projects.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that there is no simple solution to easing water woes in the Jordan Valley. Despite their low carbon footprint, Palestinians also have little control over emissions that climate scientists say are warming the planet and contributing to the warmer temperatures and prolonged drought, conditions that Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority head Atir says makes them doubly victimized.</p>
<p>“Emissions produced by Palestine are almost zero as Palestine does not have factories,” she says. “Israel also does not allow Palestinians to exploit underground water aquifers located within their land, which is a double blow.”</p>
