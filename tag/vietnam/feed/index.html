								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A boy named Nguyen Van Trong walked cautiously along a ditch while keeping his eyes trained on the ground. Every day he returns to this mangrove forest to search for discarded plastic bottles that he can sell. On a good day, he can make up to two dollars, which helps to supplement his family’s income. They are among the many in Cha Va village who are losing their farmland because of sea level rise.</p>
<div id="attachment_120" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151104112333-img-3405.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120" class="size-full wp-image-120" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151104112333-img-3405.jpg" alt="A boy collects plastic bottles to sell for money to help his family in Cha Va village, Lam Hai commune, Nam Can district, Ca Mau province.

<h2>Tarnished gold</h2>
<p>Ca Mau is Vietnam’s southernmost province and an important part of the country’s agricultural economy. The Mekong Delta region produces much of the country’s food and exports, but in the “Golden Rice Bowl,” poverty is increasing.</p>
<p>Here rice has become more expensive to produce than to sell —the result of unfavorable government policies and high costs along the production and distribution chain. Struggling farmers also face mounting pressures from changing weather patterns and the region’s intricate system of rivers and canals is being inundated with salinity from the rising ocean.</p>
<p>Rice growers in the southern provinces typically farm land that is small and fragmented, which leaves individual farmers with higher input costs and little control over supply and resulting price. Recognizing the importance of rice to Vietnam’s economy, the government instituted a floor price policy to ensure that farmers earn a 30 percent profit.</p>
<p>But enterprises rarely buy rice directly from farmers and any extra profit from higher prices goes to middle-man brokers instead. It’s a policy that’s especially damaging, said Mr. Nguyen Van Doi who manages an agricultural cooperative in Dong Thap province, because these brokers put a price squeeze on farmers, and then store and sell the product at significantly higher prices.</p>

<p>Nguyen Thi Nga lives in Kien Giang where she used to farm, but now picks up trash to make ends meet. Much of her land was lost to sea level rise and she passed on what remained to her children. Like many others in her village, she is unable to find steady work and lives in a makeshift home built near the trunk of a tree. Often when the river floods its banks, these homes are swept away, leaving Nga and her neighbors to grab their few belongings and move on.</p>
<h2>People on the move</h2>
<p>These “floating” populations are growing in number in Vietnam’s southern provinces. In addition to out-of-work farmers, there are large numbers of migrant workers who don’t have land or other skills to support their large families. Low education levels, training and available jobs are major causes of chronic poverty.</p>
<p>Nguyen Van Thoi, who lives in nearby Nam Can, has no land or farm, just a poorly constructed bamboo house that sits precariously along the riverbank. When the house collapses or washes away, his family moves to another location and rebuilds. Without any land or trade to pass on to their children, this cycle of poverty continues.</p>
<div id="attachment_107" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-2992.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107" class="size-full wp-image-107" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-2992.jpg" alt="A field suffering from salt water intrusion in Ca Mau.

<p>“Our lives here depend entirely on the rivers. [Some] days, I go fishing; on dry days…I do whatever others hire,” he said. With little rainfall over the past few months, however, earning has been difficult. In the Mekong Delta region, annual per capita income is one of the lowest in the country at $1,535 (about 34.6 million VND). The national average is just over $2,000 (46.2 million VND).</p>
<p>Professor Vu Trong Khai, an independent expert on agricultural economics and rural development, said that the rise in untrained, unemployed workers is a major challenge. Although the Mekong Delta has an abundant labor force, those who farm often do so using traditional or primitive methods, which results in the low production levels and income despite their great efforts. This also makes them vulnerable to many intermediaries, who purchase their rice at lower prices and then sell it for two to three times higher.</p>
<p>Children in the southern provinces are also suffering. According to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Education and Training, the percentage of children early dropping out of school in the Mekong Delta region is three times higher than the rest of the country. Schools in this area lack even the most basic facilities. Low education rates prevent next generations of Mekong people from accessing new skills and better opportunities, instead tying them to unstable, low-paid work in agriculture and manual production.</p>

<p>To help farmers escape from poverty, Professor Khai said it is necessary to train young laborers on professional production methods. Otherwise, the Mekong Delta will continue to rely on cheap labor and an increasingly unpredictable environment, making their source of livelihood less reliable and stable. Already, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion has caused a significant loss in viable agricultural land.</p>
<p>Many places like Dong Thap and Can Tho are especially vulnerable and have left people fleeing the advancing sea. But many lack the training and skills to find alternative jobs in the market economy or industrial goods production.</p>
<p>Warming temperatures and rising seas are threatening the second largest rice exporter in the world, but it’s the grinding poverty across the Mekong Delta region that is most visible. Without a development plan for Vietnam’s southern provinces, the lives of the people may be quickly washed away.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part of the Mekong Delta – home to 20% of Vietnam’s population and 50% of its rice production &#8211; is at risk of disappearing as sea levels rise.</em></p>
<p>In fields across Vietnam’s Ca Mau Province, one of the country’s most important agricultural regions, wispy rows of rice struggle to grow in dingy yellow water.</p>
<p>“This year’s crop is totally lost,” explained Bui Van Sim, a farmer in the province’s Le Giao village. &#8220;Saltwater has appeared everywhere. There is no rain; almost 100% of the rice has died.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_108" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3034.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" class="wp-image-108 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3034.jpg" alt="A farmer looks at his rice crop in Ca Mau.

<p>Ca Mau is a low-lying coastal region that sits along Vietnam’s southernmost tip, so flooding and seawater encroachment happen frequently. But with an average elevation of approximately one meter above sea level, Vietnamese officials say that global warming and subsequent sea level rise threatens to submerge an estimated 40% of the province.</p>
<p>Locals like Sim used to be accustomed to two seasons: one that allowed them to grow rice and another to farm shrimp. The rainy season, which lasted from June to November, flooded river banks and desalted the fields to create ideal conditions for producing rice. After the rice harvest, farmers would let the fields dry before pumping saltwater into them to breed shrimp. However, these traditional practices are slowly changing.</p>
<p>Tran Thi Diep, who also lives in Le Giao, said that this year has seen little rain, despite the abundant downfalls that usually take place between July and August. With no freshwater to flush the salt from the fields, the rice crop is suffering.</p>
<p>Of the 13 provinces in the Mekong Delta, Ca Mau and Kien Giang are two of the most seriously affected by the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>According to official estimates, 80% of Ca Mau is at risk of submersion. The province already has nearly 10,000 hectares of its agricultural land affected by salinity. Moreover, sea dikes that slow encroaching waters and prevent erosion are seriously degraded.</p>
<p>In recent years, Kien Giang has experienced heavy flooding that has devastated the province’s people and economy by destroying property, rice fields and fish farms. Regional officials estimate that if the sea level rises about 85-105 centimeters, most of Kien Giang province will also be submerged.</p>

<p>Erosion along riverbanks, islets and coastal areas is causing great difficulties for people and local governments.<em> </em>In 2009, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved plans to fund more than VND 1 trillion (over $44 million) for 51 provinces to upgrade their dyke and embankment systems. Kien Giang province has also implemented numerous action plans since 2010 to protect the coastline, including the replanting of about 430 hectares of forests.<em><br />
</em><br />
A few months ago, Long Khanh islet in nearby Dong Thap province eroded almost completely and water invaded residential areas, endangering people’s lives. Hundreds of people still need to be relocated, pushing the government into the uneasy situation of finding funds for new land.<br />
Early in September, a surge in the river washed away a home in Cha La village. Luckily, locals say the family was away that night, so no one was hurt.</p>
<p>Boating along the Nam Can River and Ganh Hao River of Ca Mau, one can see that many houses, including those made out of concrete, have collapsed along the eroding banks.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues of rising sea levels and erosion, the ground of the Mekong Delta is also in danger of serious sinking, a risk that could lead to the “disappearance” of these important fertile fields.</p>
<p>According to the Wetlands Management Research Center at Ho Chi Minh City University, the average level of sinking measured in Can Gio District, Ho Chi Minh City is 26.3 millimeters per year (mm/year); at the estuary of the Hau River (a branch of the Mekong River) in Can Tho, it is 14.2mm/year, while in Ca Mau it is 23.4mm/year.</p>
<div id="attachment_112" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3320.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112" class="size-full wp-image-112" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-3320.jpg" alt="Two men build an embankment to prevent seawater from entering Chava village.

<p>As a result, seawater has slowly seeped into the coastal region’s rivers, canals and ponds, rendering the groundwater system undrinkable. Some districts such as Bien Bach and Thoi Binh in Ca Mau province, and An Bien and An Minh in Kien Giang province also suffer from chronic water shortages.</p>
<p>Although they live their lives surrounded by water, the residents of the Mekong Delta are thirsty.</p>
<p>Mr. Nguyen Van Cuong, who lives in Thoi Binh, is lucky enough to have a rare freshwater well, but he worries that this resource will soon be exhausted. Many people who live here must abandon wells because of saltwater intrusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nowadays, it is harder for us to pump water by hand,” Cuong said. “In the last two years, we couldn’t pump water by hand as the water was depleted. The depth of the well is also increasing.”</p>
<p>During the rainy season, people can collect rain water or share a groundwater well. In the dry season, however, water scarcity becomes a major problem and the price to transport freshwater to the Mekong’s depleted regions is expensive: VND100,000/cubic meter (approximately $4.50), a hefty sum for the many earning only VND20,000 per day.</p>
<p>“Previously, we could find freshwater after a few tens of meters of drilling,” said Cuong. “At present, finding water at more than 100 meters of drilling is still hard; if they drill at a shallower level, there is only salty water and alum.”</p>
<div id="attachment_106" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-2963.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106" class="size-full wp-image-106" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/20151103162645-img-2963.jpg" alt="Many households in Le Giao hamlet, Thoi Binh district cannot use water from drilling wells because the underground water is contaminated by salt, alum water.

<p>According to Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the Mekong Delta could see a rise in its average temperature by 1.3 to 2.8 degrees Celsius and a rise in sea level by 66 to 99 centimeters by the end of this century. Though rain has been scarce this year, the Ministry estimates that the region could see an increase in rainfall of 4-8%, which could increase the risk of severe flooding. A United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report showed that a one meter rise in sea level could result in 22 million Vietnamese people left homeless and a loss of up to 10% of Vietnam’s gross domestic product.</p>
<p>In an attempt to mitigate these impacts, many studies and projects on climate change in the Mekong Delta region have been launched worldwide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Global Climate Change (IPCC), for example, has recommended measures for countries facing similar predicaments: upgrade dike systems and coastal construction, and switch to more resistant crops and livestock.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kien Giang province approved a VND390 billion (nearly $20 million) project to build a sea dike system along the coast of the city of Rach Gia. This is a part of a larger project to upgrade the dike system from the central coast province of Quang Ngai to Kien Giang under the orders of the Prime Minister. The project is expected to be completed in 2016.</p>
<p>But this progress also bears potential risks. Interference to the natural flows along the Mekong River may have unexpected consequences downstream.</p>
<p>In early September, the Lao National Assembly officially approved the Don Sahong hydropower project, which is set to be built on the Mekong River starting in late 2015, less than two kilometers from the Laos-Cambodian border. Environmentalists fear it will have a disastrous impact on the Delta’s key fishing industries.</p>
<p>When a large area with many residents is affected, many people are forced to migrate and seek assistance. This is a grave problem for land management and social security – a problem that worsens in the Mekong Delta with each passing year.</p>
