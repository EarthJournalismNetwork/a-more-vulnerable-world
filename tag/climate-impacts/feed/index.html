								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Extreme weather events are destroying the silkworms that produce Assam’s famous golden silk</strong></p>
<p>Assam, in North-east India, produces one of the finest, and most expensive, types of silk in the world. Produced by the semi-domesticated silkworm <em>Antheraea assamensis,</em> which is only found in the Brahmaputra Valley, this silk is called <em>Muga</em> –  Assamese for “yellow” or “amber” –  and is often called golden silk. This silk has been produced in the region from as far back as 321 BC, and is an inextricable part of the life and culture of Assam. Unfortunately silkworms are highly sensitive to climatic conditions since they are grown outdoors. Recently unpredictable rainfall patterns, a rise in temperature and persistent floods have endangered <em>Muga</em> cocoon production across the state.</p>
<p>Due to the long history of sericulture, <em>Muga</em> silk occupies a special place in the lives of the indigenous people, inextricably linked to their cultural life. Moreover <em>Muga silk</em> is one of the most expensive silks in the world due its durability and beauty. The lustre of the fabric increases with each wash, making it a product that is treasured – and which lasts – throughout the lifetime of its owner. In 2007, Assam received the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for <em>Muga</em> silk. A GI tag is given to products that are produced in a particular area, and boosts the reputation of the product.</p>
<div id="attachment_40" style="width: 993px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40" class="size-full wp-image-40" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg" alt="A set of mekhela chadors made with Assamese muga silk arranged around a japi (Credit: Satnath)" width="983" height="800" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800.jpg 983w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assamese_Muga_With_Japi-983x800-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-40" class="wp-caption-text">A set of mekhela chadors made with Assamese muga silk arranged around a japi (Credit: Satnath)</p></div>
<p>There is a demand for more than 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of <em>Muga</em> silk annually, but the state has been producing an average 90 mt per year. In 2011-12 the production increased a little to 115 mt, according to sources from the Sericulture Department. However there are fears of negative or stagnant results in the next crop seasons. This year’s crop production was affected by rising temperature and floods.</p>
<h2><strong>A flood of troubles in Dhemaji</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhemaji_district">Dhemaji district</a> in northern Assam is a major <em>Muga</em> growing area. About 98% of the people of the district live in the rural areas and agriculture is the principal occupation for more than 85% of the people. These families are also engaged in <em>Muga</em> cultivation. <em>Muga</em> cultivation is a labour intensive activity and almost all the family members of the household are involved in silkworm rearing, silk reeling and weaving. Unfortunately for the farmers of Dhemaji floods are destroying the basis of this industry.</p>
<p>The district has experienced recurrent floods, on an annual basis for the last few years. The Dhemaji Agriculture Department put the number of farm families affected this year at 50,500. Assam has an average <a href="http://www.jsk.gov.in/dlhs3/assam.pdf">family size of just under 5 people per family</a>, which would mean that almost 250,000 people would have been affected out of a total population of <a href="http://www.census2011.co.in/census/district/147-dhemaji.html">about 700,000.</a> A total of 3,718 hectares of agricultural land was covered in silt this year, pushing the affected people to search alternative livelihood in non-agricultural sector.</p>
<div id="attachment_41" style="width: 1030px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" class="size-full wp-image-41" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg" alt="The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)" width="1020" height="633" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods.jpg 1020w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Assam-floods-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-41" class="wp-caption-text">The catastrophic floods in Assam in September 2015 (Credit: Mubina Akhtar)</p></div>
<p>The floods and siltation have destroyed, or endangered, plantations of the Som plant, on which the <em>Muga</em> silkworms feed. The Som plantations – known as <em>Sumonis</em> – have been gradually destroyed as they have either been displaced, or their roots buried in sandy silt. Kusha Sonowal of Laomuri village, Dhemaji, said that the unavailability of good quality seeds has severely affected indigenous <em>Muga</em> rearing. Abandoning her expertise in weaving, she now helps her family run a small tea stall some 2 kilometres from her home.</p>
<h2><strong>Loss linked to change in temperature and humidity</strong></h2>
<p>Joya Duvarah, who now runs a small shop near the main road in Laomuri village, laments that her family would have earned millions if only their once prosperous <em>Muga</em> cultivation thrived. The chronic havoc of flood brought disaster and they had to cut down hectares of their Som plantations that had rotted after being submerged for months. “Apart from floods that have eaten away our <em>Sumonis</em>, a rise in temperature has brought down the production. The silkworms that are grown outside cannot bear so much heat. Vagaries of weather are responsible for premature death of worms.” she added.</p>
<p>The silkworm needs temperatures of around 30-35 degree Celsius and a humidity level of 80-85% in order to thrive. Dhemaji suffered heavy losses in <em>Muga</em> production in the last couple of years as silkworms died out due to the increase of air temperature and humidity, according to the Sericulture Department of Assam.  The current records show the annual rainfall of the district ranges from 2600 mm to 3200 mm, the relative humidity varies from 90% to 73% while the temperature varies between 39.9C in summer and 5.9C in winter. Changes in temperature and humidity lead to diseases like <a href="http://www.thethirdpole.net/2015/beth.walker/Downloads/Flacherie,%20and%20Grasserie">Flacherie</a>, and Grasserie that can wipe out an entire lot of silkworms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tocklai.net/">Tocklai Experimental Station</a>, the premier body in tea research in the state and the oldest tea research station in the world, has observed that in the last 90 there has been a <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090328/jsp/northeast/story_10728043.jsp">rise in temperature of 1.5C in many areas, and that the rainfall has decreased by 200mm on average</a>, and is now down to <a href="http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/urban/rainfall.htm">2,800mm a year</a>. Climate change compels tea cultivators to use more pesticides to kill pests and mites in their garden. This pesticide contaminates the air, and silkworms die when they breathe in the pesticides used in tea gardens nearby.</p>
<p>Though climate change has been affecting silkworms in Assam, there is no research or planning to save the glorious silk of Assam. Sources at the zonal office of the Central Silk Board in, Guwahati, the state capital, say that the board has not initiated any study on the impacts of climate change on <em>Muga</em> silk production.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixty two-year-old Luciano Mangaeao of Paranora in Beira, Mozambique could not hide his fear.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his hand on a sweltering afternoon and remarked dejectedly: “It’s almost rain season and I know what it means for us. It means a season of suffering; floods and storms are coming again.”</p>
<p>Though he has lived with his family in Paranora on the coast of the Indian Ocean for over three decades, the extreme weather events experienced in Beira over the past decade have left him and other residents at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>Beira, a colonial city that sprouted in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, was originally designed to accommodate 30,000 people, but today it is Mozambique’s second largest city with a population of more than 500,000. The city is a critical gateway to the sea for landlocked countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, but many of the residents live in abject poverty.</p>
<p>Experts say that tropical cyclones build up over the Indian Ocean and send water surging into Beira, inundating residential and poverty-stricken areas, many of which are below sea level. Within hours, the drainage system backs up, evacuation routes are cut off, and fecal material seeps into the fields and the food chain, even contaminating drinking water.</p>
<p>Figures from the Mozambican government reveal that between 1980 and 1993, two category three or higher cyclones hit the country, compared to seven in the period between 1994 and 2007.According to a 2013 report,<em>Assessing the Risk of Cyclone-Induced Storm Surge and Sea-level Rise in Mozambique</em>, wind risks in Beira are much higher than in the capital, Maputo. Maputo is more effectively shielded by the Madagascar land-mass, which also tends to dissipate cyclone energy, so the probability of intense wind events is much higher in Beira.</p>
<div id="attachment_267" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267" class="size-large wp-image-267" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A house in Beira that was destroyed by a tropical cyclone (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/House-in-Beira-distroyed-by-a-tropical-cyclone1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-267" class="wp-caption-text">A house in Beira that was destroyed by a tropical cyclone (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>“During the rainy season some parts of Beira experience massive flooding and we are forced to abandon our homes and move to higher areas inland. We lose property worth thousands of dollars each season but because our lives depend on the sea we have no choice but to return after the floods,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>Some buildings have been abandoned for good and are left to slowly crumble. A deserted government building stands close to the sea, so are many others including shops and beer halls. Roads have been also been destroyed.</p>
<p>The crudely built stone, sack and sand sea walls tell a story of poverty as Beira struggles to adapt to climate change-induced calamities. Some of the sea barricades have succumbed to tropical cyclones and storms. Other parts of the barricades are slowly receding into the rising sea water.</p>
<p>The extreme weather events in Beira are beyond the comprehension of many, with some residents convinced that the apocalyptic end is nigh.</p>
<p>“No one is telling us what is happening but from the stories we hear on television the future does not look good for us,” Mangaeao said.</p>
<p>His fears were shared by Luiza Ferenando, an illiterate middle aged woman who lives in Storire, a neighborhood in the city.</p>
<p>“My life depends on fishing and I can’t leave this place. I have no other opportunities outside this area,” she said.</p>
<div id="attachment_266" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" class="size-large wp-image-266" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg" alt="Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fishing-is-one-of-the-major-economic-activity-in-Beira-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-266" class="wp-caption-text">Fishing is a major economic activities in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>Thirty four-year-old Eduardo Fuinouto has been living in Paranora for sixteen years, selling different wares to the fishermen in Beira.</p>
<p>“When storms come our businesses come to a halt and we move to higher grounds. But our future is here and we hope our mayor will do something to serve our city and our businesses,” Fuinouto said.</p>
<p>Faustino Estacha, a twenty three-year-old university student, also remains optimistic that the mayor of Beirahas bigger plans to save the city.</p>
<p>“One of these plans is to build a sea wall which can save our homes,” he said.</p>
<p>He added: “People have nice homes and they can’t just leave but the barricades which used to be here have been destroyed by the sea water.”</p>
<p>According to Bill McKibben, a U.S.-based climate activist and founder of <em>350.org</em>, some communities facing rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions have no choice but to leave for good.</p>
<p>“Building sea walls is an option, but very expensive. The frustration is that the world seems not care. It’s a very depressing situation and some people (living on coastal areas) have to pack their bags and go,” McKibben said.</p>
<p>In the face of this growing threat, Graca Machel, a human rights activist and member of The Elders, an independent group of global leaders who work together for peace and human rights,urges coastal countries to develop programs to better assist these vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>“Countries on coastal areas should come up with policies on how to protect communities or encourage the people to move a little further from the coast,” Machel said.</p>
<p>The mayor of Beira, Daviz Simango, said more than 100,000 residents living in low lying areas in the city will have to be relocated to higher areas in the next decade.</p>
<div id="attachment_265" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" class="size-large wp-image-265" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg" alt="A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)" width="760" height="503" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A-stone-sea-wall-in-Beira1-1020x676.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-265" class="wp-caption-text">A ship washed up along a stone sea wall in Beira (Credit: Andrew Mambondiyani)</p></div>
<p>He was quick to add that the city needed more than US$100 million to address climate change-induced problems, an amount that he said the city could not raise without the intervention of the private sector.</p>
<p>A Dutch engineering firm, Deltares, is working with other private companies like Witteveen +Bos, Wissing, Niras Mozambique and VandenBroek Consulting to partner with the city of Beira to develop a so-called <em>Beira Master Plan 2035 </em>and avert a full-on climate change disaster.</p>
<p>“Two important initiatives in this respect are: capacity building and institutional strengthening focused on the planning and enforcement capacity of municipality and the establishment of the Beira Land Development Company,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Simango said the Land Development Company, which will be a partnership between the city and private investors, will assist in the implementation of a new finance model where financial feasibility of the Beira Municipality and of the masterplan is increased through several business cases.</p>
<p>“The selling of dredging sand and the selling of land with road and drainage infrastructure are important income generating elements of this finance model,” Simango said.</p>
<p>Deltares senior project manager Peter Letitre said they would establish a land development company through an initial investment of up to US$20 million.</p>
<p>“A reasonable starting budget would be around US$10- $20 million. Planning capacity and financial means need to be mobilized. Besides, a better (win-win) cooperation between City and Port of Beira is very important for the economic growth of the Port and the City”.</p>
<p>According to this ambitious plan, the city needs to stop uncontrolled issuing of land to developers especially in areas which should be designated for water retention.</p>
<p>There is also a need to plan, zone and enforce land reserved for important future infrastructure projects like retention basins, drainage canals, sewage lines and roads. Assessments of the potential vulnerabilities of vital infrastructure – such as power lines, roads and railways – to flooding, and repairs of these weaknesses must also be conducted.</p>
<p>But significant obstacles to the implementation of such plans remain.</p>
<p>Land regulations in Beira are poorly enforced, which contributes to fragmented urban development. Here, speculators purchase property at low prices with the hope of later turning a profit, and are not willing to give it to the government for infrastructure projects. Because there is no incentive for these private developers to work alongside government plans, sustainable development in Beira remains just out of reach.</p>

<p>Letitre said the government must play a critical role in designating and enforcing reserved spaces for important future projects.</p>
<p>“This is a complex process for which cooperation of the inhabitants is very important. Ordinary people (in Beira) are also involved in planning of various projects such as the drainage projects in various neighborhoods, in cooperation with the authorities. They are also involved in operation and maintenance of drainage projects and solid waste projects,” Letitre said.</p>
<p>Despite these hurdles, Letitre remains bullish on Beira’s future. “After the master plan is successfully implemented,” he said, “Beira will be a safer, more sustainable, prosperous and beautiful city.”</p>
<p>These are hopeful words, but one thing is certain: successful implementation of the Beira Master Plan will require the participation of key stakeholders in the city or risk facing the same fate as similar plans that have come before it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are troubled waters ahead for a Polynesia group of people within the Melanesian country of Solomon Islands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>With more than half a million residents, the Solomon Islands is comprised of mostly dark-skinned Melanesian people with a smaller population of fairer skinned Micronesian and Polynesians.</p>
<p>As many of these minority populations have been swallowed up by the mainstream Melanesian group on the larger islands, the remote Polynesian outliers in the archipelago Ontong Java (commonly referred to as Lord Howe by Solomon Islanders) are also being slowly consumed, but by the sea.</p>

<p>The Ontong Java group is one of the largest in the world consisting of 120 small, low coral atolls that enclose a vast lagoon extending 70 kilometers from Luaniua in the southeast to Pelau in the north.</p>
<p>Approximately 3,000 people live in both permanent and semi-permanent houses on both islands.</p>
<p>The Lord Howe Settlement in the capital of Honiara is home to some 600 people from Ontong Java Atoll who can only claim ancestral ties to the atoll, but have no permanent home.</p>
<p>These residents are susceptible to sea level rise, tsunami, heat waves and other natural disasters like cyclones. But even more troubles lie ahead for those who could be forced to leave their homes from the natural intrusion of the rising Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Their traditional food sources like swamp taro, potato, coconut and other fruit trees are being threatened by the current El Nino -induced drought. Over-fishing and extraction of sea resources like sea cucumber for commercial use by local residents means sea food and marine lives are also becoming scarce.</p>
<p>Root crops such as swamp taro are dying due to salt-water infiltrating into the land, which is no more than three meters above sea level.</p>

<p>Their strong attachment to the land, sea, family and culture could be destroyed by the very ocean they depended on for thousands of years, as well as from normal occurrences such as tropical cyclones on this remote part of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Government intervention so far has been through the subsidization of shipping costs for basic food items like rice, biscuits, sugar and needed fuel for fishing boat engines.</p>
<p>On the regional level, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) initiated the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) project, mainly focused on exploring food security for the Ontong Javans.</p>
<h2>Canary in the coal mine</h2>
<p>In many ways, atoll residents are the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the Soloman Islands archipelago when it comes to natural disasters. They are the first to be affected by the rising threats of climate change.</p>
<p>Adaptation measures under PACC such as new methods of farming and packaging of local food sources have received some coverage, but it’s the question of ‘relocation’ that has dominated mainstream discourses on a national and regional level. The Ontong Java Atoll and other low-lying islands in the Pacific Ocean such as Tuvalu and Kiribati face common threats from climate-induced impacts on their environment and livelihoods.</p>

<p>Work is underway on a national climate change policy, according to Dr. Melchoir Mataki, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Disaster Management and Meteorology (MECDM). “The current government made it a priority for us to develop a climate change legislation,” he said. “Preparatory work on the draft legislation has been completed and this will be further advanced in 2016.”</p>
<p>Mataki acknowledged that the issue of relocation is often perceived as a last option, but for many parts of the country it’s becoming the only “reasonable” option left. “[It] cannot be postponed any longer,” he said,” however relocation is a sensitive and delicate matter because it touches a variety of contentious issues such as land tenure and finance.”</p>
<p>“[It’s] not only about the physical relocation of people and their properties,” Mataki added, “but also entails political, social, economic and cultural shifts and losses for people who will move and those who will receive them.” For these reasons, he said the government is focusing on identifying the country’s most vulnerable populations in order to come up with appropriate relocation guidelines. Responsibility for this task has fallen to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey (MLH&amp;S).</p>
<p>Relocation may be the only solution for the people of Ontong Java Atoll in the near future, but it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Scott Leckie who currently serves as the director of Displacement Solutions, a Geneva-based NGO working to assist people who are displaced from their homes due to conflict or climate change shared similar sentiments.</p>
<div id="attachment_563" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-563" class="size-large wp-image-563" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1024x579.jpg" alt="The beautiful coast is slowly eroding (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="430" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1024x579.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-300x170.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-672x380.jpg 672w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/The-beautiful-coast-is-eroding-slowly-1020x577.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-563" class="wp-caption-text">The beautiful coast is slowly eroding (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>“Our position is essentially that no one should ever be forced to move from their traditional homes and land,” he said,” and that if planned relocation is contemplated, that this must be voluntary and wholly-driven by the people themselves, supported by a large majority of those to relocate, and be relocated to a place of the community&#8217;s choosing.”</p>
<p>Leckie, who was born in Los Angeles with Netherlands citizenship and currently resides in Australia said planned relocation processes should be guided by the Peninsula Principles on Climate Displacement Within States (2013) and appropriate, detailed and adequately funded planning must precede any actual movement of people.</p>
<p>“As with all citizens from Ontong Java, the people of the atoll have rights and any relocation must be a right-based approach which respects, preserves and improves their human rights in the process,” he said.</p>
<p>Some residents have gone on record to say that is relocation becomes necessary, they would choose to move to Isabel Province, which is larger than the province under which they are currently governed as part of the Malaita Outer Islands (MOI).</p>
<p>In such cases, Leckie said that intensive work should be done with host communities near the relocation site to ensure a smooth transition. “A successful of relocation is extremely difficult, but it can work if all parties work together to make it work,” he noted.</p>
<p>His firm, Displacement Solutions, has experience on the ground in Ontong Java. Their photojournalist Beni Knight spend two months on the atoll this year documenting the ongoing challenges faced by residents. Relocation, Leckie said, appears all but certain. “Land is eroding fast, some villages have already disappeared, crops are ever more difficult to grow,” he said. “If relocation is the option the people of Ontong Java choose, this will be particularly difficult for older people, many of whom will not want to leave and who may have never or very rarely ever left the atoll before.”</p>
<div id="attachment_561" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-561" class="size-large wp-image-561" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1024x643.jpg" alt="A section of the atoll's coastline (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="477" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1024x643.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-300x188.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rsz_part_of_the_atoll-1020x641.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-561" class="wp-caption-text">A section of the atoll&#8217;s coastline (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>When it comes to climate displacement, experts say that people face a difficult choice: stay and adapt, move as a community in a planned manner, or migrate on a person by person or family by family basis. “We generally favor relocation over migration as it is organized, well thought-out, and planned,” Leckie said. “It has the best chance of preserving the unique cultures that so many people of the islands live with and cherish so much.”</p>
<p>Equally vulnerable are Ontong Javans residing in the heart of capital Honiara in the Lord Howe Settlement. The Settlement is located beside the river and coast of Mataniko River delta.</p>
<p>A United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment in 2014 noted the Settlement has an area of 2.8 hectares with a population of 631–295 men and 336 women. According to the report, there is a population density of 223 persons per hectare, “the highest among the hotspots studied…packed with houses spaced closely together.”</p>
<p>Doctorate student Coggan Kuare, who left the Solomon Islands to study at Hokkaido University in Japan, said the Settlement itself needs relocating as the devastating floods of April 2014 which killed more than 20 people indicate that climate change poses great risk to the settlers.</p>
<p>“Flooding from Mataniko River, sea level rise and tsunami are the greatest threats to the Ontong Java settlers of Lord Howe Settlement,” said Kuare whose is working on the thesis “Disposition, Expansion and Relocation of Honiara City.”</p>
<h2>Hoping for change</h2>
<p>With world leaders gathered in Paris for the United Nations (UN) climate negotations, the plight of Ontong Javans both on the atoll and Lord Howe Settlement cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>This year Reverend Nigel Kelaepa, a prominent Ontong Javan is observing the negotiations in Paris. It’s his first time at such a high level climate event.</p>
<p>The issue of relocation may appear insignificant to some, but reducing global greenhouse gas emissions could save the Ontong Javans from the rising sea level. Led by Samuel Manetoali from the Minister of Environment, Climate Change and Disaster and Meteorology (MECDM), the Solomon Islands delegation to Paris has joined other small island states to lobby for the reduction of the global greenhouse gases.</p>
<div id="attachment_557" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-557" class="size-large wp-image-557" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-1024x571.jpg" alt="Local residents say they're worried that their plight is invisible to world leaders gathered in Paris (Credit: Mike Sama)" width="760" height="424" srcset="https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-1024x571.jpg 1024w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-300x167.jpg 300w, https://climate.earthjournalism.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Local-residents-just-want-some-attention-on-their-plight-1020x568.jpg 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-557" class="wp-caption-text">Local residents say they&#8217;re worried that their plight is invisible to world leaders gathered in Paris (Credit: Mike Sama)</p></div>
<p>“We want an ambitious and legally binding agreement within the context of the UNFCCC that obliges major emitters to reduce their emissions to restrain global temperature change to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius, treats loss and damage as a distinct element of the agreement separate from adaptation, recognizes the special case of the most vulnerable parties such as the Solomon Islands, and fast tracks financial and technical resources in the most transparent, accessible and ‘non-loan’ modalities to meet our adaptation and mitigation needs,” said Dr. Mataki, MECDM’s Permanent Secretary.</p>
<p>In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted to the UNFCCC, the Solomon Islands pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12% below 2015 levels by 2025 and 30% below 2015 levels by 2030. With international assistance, the Solomon Islands can reduce its emissions by more than 50% by 2050, but Mataki said the pledges of major emitters have fallen short. “Global action to address climate change must not leave anyone behind,” he said, “it must be inclusive as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Politics aside, the people of Ontong Java bear little responsibility for the rising seas, but residents are looking to world leaders to address the root causes of their plight before their island home disappears under their feet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abdullah Salam walks up and down his narrow plot, tossing fistfuls of wheat seeds with a light flick of his wrist as the soil squishes beneath his bare feet. “<em>Elhamdullillah,</em>” he says—praise God—a strong rain just came through and softened the ground. A month ago, this earth was as hard as asphalt.</p>
<p>These days, it feels to Salam like his soil is fighting him. It’s quick to dry out, turning hard and gray. The seeds don’t seem to like it: No matter how much money he spends on fertilizers, he’s getting slightly lower yields every harvest. And no matter how much he irrigates the land, it’s always thirsty. Always.</p>
<div id="attachment_33" style="width: 770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/3-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33" class="size-large wp-image-33" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/11/3-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="A thin white film on the sun-scorched earth in a field betrays the reason for dying crops; salt.

<p>But there’s nothing to be done about it, and there’s no one to complain to here in Kafr el-Sheikh, in the center of Egypt’s Nile Delta, so Salam carries on planting. He, his wife and his 15-year-old son, Mohammed, scatter the wheat seeds around his 2-acre field. Their neighbor then drives his tractor through it, tilling the soil and pushing the seeds deep into the ground. Once that’s done, they all have tea and wait.</p>
<p>“The harvest will be in five or six months, <em>inshallah</em> [God willing],” Salam says. “One [acre] used to yield 18 or 20 <em>ardab</em> [worth about $1000]. But now we’ll probably only get 10.” Salam will sell half of that at market for about $250, and the other half his wife will mill into flour and bake into bread. But it’s nearly impossible to make such a small amount of flour stretch until the next harvest, she says.</p>
<p>This land, where the Nile spreads out to meet the sea, once grew enough wheat to feed everyone from Cairo to Rome—the breadbasket of the world, they called it. Today, the delta barely feeds the farmers who cultivate it. Salam blames his diminishing returns on rising fertilizer prices and bad luck.</p>
<p>But it’s not bad luck—it’s the sea. It’s warming, rising and expanding onto the low-lying, delta lands and seeping into the water that feeds them. By the end of the century, <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">60 percent</a> of the delta region—including Salam’s field—will be so saturated with salt as to be barely farmable. As much as <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">20 percent</a> of this once-fertile land will be covered in water. When this happens, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/21/climate-change-nile-flooding-farming">two-thirds</a> of Egypt’s food will drown and two-thirds of the country’s <a href="http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/10/10873/2013/hessd-10-10873-2013-print.pdf">population</a> will be left homeless and hungry.</p>
<h2><strong>The salt shakedown<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Sadek Mahmoud has been working the plot next to Salam’s for 65 years. He remembers when the Nile used to flood his irrigation canals every year with clear, nutrient-rich water. “I used to drink from the Nile right here. And I never ever got sick,” Mahmoud says.</p>
<p>For centuries, farmers relied solely on the Nile to water their cropland, digging a complex network of irrigation canals to connect the entire delta region to the river and its tributaries. But as Egypt’s population has soared, so has its water consumption; and as factories, power plants and megacities have emerged along the Nile’s banks, the clear, rich water of Mahmoud’s youth has been fouled by all manner of human, chemical and industrial waste. Nowadays, by the time the Nile reaches Salam and Mahmoud’s fields, it has been reduced to a brown, toxic trickle.</p>
<p>To compensate, the farmers in the area have dug a well. Salam and Mahmoud, along with about a dozen of their neighbors, take turns running a fuel-powered pump to flood their respective irrigation canals with water from the <a href="https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mXCqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;dq=nile+delta+aquifer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CNUqnxVmFP&amp;sig=fo96poV9yBUodDFZBBUGOBJwKC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAmoVChMI2uuoy6WDyQIVzLIUCh3vAQ8N#v=onepage&amp;q=nile%20delta%20aquifer&amp;f=false">Nile Delta aquifer</a>, a massive underground reservoir, spanning from Cairo to the Mediterranean Sea.  On the surface, this seems like a good solution to the delta’s water shortage problem, but this sort of pumping is accelerating the region’s demise, according to Badr Mabrouk, a hydrology professor at Zagazig University. “When you draw the water up from the deep aquifers, it creates pressure and it draws the sea in,” Mabrouk said.</p>
<p>Rising sea levels had already put the Nile Delta aquifer in peril before farmers began deep-well pumping, Mabrouk explained, but they have made it worse. The way coastal aquifers work is that they meet and hold back the sea underground at a point called the transition zone: The higher density saltwater sinks and gets pulled back toward the ocean and the freshwater remains on top. As long as sea levels—and aquifer levels—remain stable, this meeting point doesn’t move.</p>
<p>But if either the sea rises or the fresh water recedes, this point moves farther inland: The sea advances underground. In the case of the Nile Delta, both are happening and they’re happening quickly, Mabrouk said. As the ocean warms and its waters expand, sea levels in Egypt are rising, and the land is sinking at a rate of 0.1 inches per year as a result, according to the <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Documents/nile_e.pdf">Climate Change Adaptation in Africa Program</a>. Meanwhile, excessive pumping is draining the aquifer faster than rainfall can refill it.</p>

<p>Climate scientists and geologists have been warning of the danger of saltwater intrusion in Egypt’s Delta for decades. But in a country riven with political upheaval and economic insecurity, the environment has never been the government’s priority—and still isn’t, according to Hassan Husseiny, a water management specialist for the American University in Cairo’s <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Sustainability/Rise/Pages/Home.aspx">Research Institute for Sustainable Environment</a>. “Studies say climate change could begin to have a real effect after 20 years,” Husseiny says. “The government doesn’t look that far ahead.”</p>
<p>But up in the northern Delta region, sea-level rise is no longer a matter of looking ahead: On a daily basis, the sea is pounding away at the populous cities of Alexandria, Damietta and Port Said. If the sea rises by even 20 inches (which <a href="http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise">a 2014 National Climate Assessment</a> projects will likely occur by 2100) <a href="http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Mohamed.pdf">30 percent of Alexandria</a>, a city of 5 million, will be inundated.</p>
<p>In the popular coastal resort town of Baltim, about 30 miles north of Kafr el-Sheikh, mango farmer Mossad Abu Ghali has seen the sea advancing. “I remember when they had to build a new boardwalk because the old one got ruined by the sea,” Abu Ghali says. “That was a long time ago though. Inshallah, the sea is not advancing anymore.” Baltim built a seawall in 1992 out of large, concrete tetrapod blocks. This has slowed—but not stopped—the sea’s advance. This type of structure, known as a <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/statclim/whatcanbedone.html">revetment</a>, has an average life span of 30 to 50 years. Already the wall is half-buried in sand.</p>
<p>All along the coast, cities and towns like Baltim have constructed sea walls to try and hold back the water, but even with these measures in place, Husseiny predicted that no fewer than 10 million people would be displaced in the next 30 years.</p>
<h2><strong>The Delta’s eleventh hour</strong></h2>
<p>In 1972, Egypt launched the Coastal Research Institute (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Coastal-Research-Institute-Cori-436770736371496/info/?tab=overview">CORI</a>) to “monitor and protect” the Egyptian coast, but to date, its work has focused far more on monitoring than protecting. “There has yet to be any action taken in the delta that I know of,” Husseiny said. “There have been conferences and meetings and discussions but no action.”</p>
<p>The institute’s current flagship program is a joint venture started in 2009 with the United Nations Development Program and Global Environment Facility. The project is to create “<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/dam/egypt/docs/Environment%20and%20Energy/Climate%20Change%20Project%20Document.pdf">integrated coastal zone management systems</a>” on Egypt’s coasts by building sea barriers out of natural materials. Six years and <a href="http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/sccf-czm-egypt">$4 million later</a>, they have managed to “select a pilot site,” design an “adaptation technique” and solicit bids from contractors to work on a pilot site—but have <a href="http://www.eg.undp.org/content/egypt/en/home/operations/projects/environment_and_energy/project_sample.html">yet to build</a> a single sea barrier.</p>
<p>Aymen el-Gamal, CORI’s deputy director, works out of an office less than half a mile from the sea, and he doesn’t deny the sea levels are rising. But, he says, there is little use in trying to predict the rate at which it will rise—and there’s no sense in planning more  than one or two years ahead. Most existing models are just alarmist and unhelpful, el-Gamal says. He’s also unconvinced human-induced climate change is real. “The Earth is very clever. It can take in energy and emit it,” el-Gamal says. “There are those who say there is the greenhouse effect and the ozone—no, the Earth is bigger than all of this.” His smile is confident and kind. “So the climate change from my point of view is a normal phenomenon.” Which is why he sees his role as one of simply monitoring sea-level rise and adapting to the data as it comes in.</p>
<p>For farmers like Salam, Mahmoud and Abu Ghali, however, that won’t work. The hour is late for the delta. “The land is slowly, slowly running out of time,” Mabrouk said. Egypt’s primary food source is sinking into the sea while its government—and the international community—watches on.</p>

<p>Global leaders are gearing up for the landmark COP21 climate change summit in Paris, where they are hoping to reach consensus on a new set of regulations for greenhouse gas emissions to replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2020. But even the most aggressive of global reforms won’t do a thing to save Egypt’s Nile Delta. Even if global leaders succeed in their goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (an ambitious goal to begin with), the seas are expected to continue rising for decades to come, according to a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2015/071615-international-report-confirms-2014-was-earths-warmest-year-on-record.html">report</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.</p>
<p>Land loss and damage from climate change are on the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/session/9057.php">agenda</a> for the summit, but it’s unlikely that Egypt’s case will be discussed specifically. Ultimately, the United Nations Framework for Climate Change has left it to individual countries to develop their own <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/workstreams/national_adaptation_plans/items/6057.php">National Adaptation Plans</a>. Egypt’s prime minister formed a <a href="http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/07/17/egypt-to-form-national-climate-change-council/">National Committee on Climate Change</a> in July to draft an up-to-date national strategy for combatting the problem, but a copy of this strategy has not been made public (if indeed it has been fully drafted).</p>
<p>In the meantime, there has been little if any international pressure on Egypt to update its national strategy expediently. All international critiques of Egypt tend to focus on the country’s national security problems, human rights abuses and poor democratic governance. As long as climate change remains a second-tier issue for the international community, the Egyptian state—and its people—will also regard it as one.</p>
<p>Even Abu Ghali, whose mango trees could be floating in saltwater within his lifetime, believes tackling climate change should come second to tightening security and restoring the economy. He has full confidence his president will help him in due time. “The government is under a lot of pressure,” Abu Ghali says. “We can’t expect everything to come all at once. [President Abdel-Fattah ] el-Sissi needs to first give jobs to people who need them. Later, he will help us.” Inshallah.</p>
